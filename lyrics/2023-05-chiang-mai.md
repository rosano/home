# James Taylor: You've Got A Friend

When you′re down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, oh, nothing is going right

Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, oh, yeah, baby
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you′ve got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud now
Soon I′ll be knocking upon your door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I′ll come running, oh, yes, I will
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall, yeah
All you've got to do is call
And I′ll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, ain't it good to know that you′ve got a friend?
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well, they′ll take your soul if you let them
Oh, yeah, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Oh, baby don′t you know ′bout
Winter, spring, summer or fall
Hey, now, all you've got to do is call
Lord, I′ll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend

You′ve got a friend, yeah
Ain't it good to know you′ve got a friend?
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
Oh, yeah, yeah, you′ve got a friend
