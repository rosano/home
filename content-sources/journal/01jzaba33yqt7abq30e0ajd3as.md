[The rise of Whatever](https://eev.ee/blog/2025/07/03/the-rise-of-whatever/)

> The Web is a cool thing because anyone can just put stuff on it.  It is the largest town square bulletin board ever devised.  Back in the day, your ISP would even give you your own website!  I don’t think they do that so much any more, but there are more cheap or free options than ever — hell, you can host a little website on GitHub.
> 
> And it used to mostly consist of little things made by people, and that was pretty cool!  You would see more than four websites in a day.  Websites would have colors!  They wouldn’t all be designed for a three-inch-wide screen and then just scaled up when you’re at your desk!  Twitter once let you set your own background image for when people looked at your profile.

> Look at it.  Look at it, you stupid baby.  Look how outlandish or shocking or extreme or dramatic, Whatever it is.  Just shut up and look at it, so Home Depot will give me a quarter of a tenth of a cent.

> At least when I write a lot, you know it’s because I wanted to write it.  Also I’m probably not lying to you because someone paid me to do it!

> But we didn’t really get that.  We got, I guess, sparkling autocomplete — a fancy chatbot that can string words together in the most inoffensive people-pleasing customer-service voice you’ve ever heard.

> What even is this thing we’ve invented?  Stack Overflow, but you only get the answers people scramble to type first so they can get the points?  Oh and they just lie to you sometimes?  Why would I want this?
