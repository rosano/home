[Immutable Infrastructure, Immutable Code](https://aicoding.leaflet.pub/3mbaguyrjek2g)

> A system becomes legacy when understanding it requires historical knowledge that isn't encoded anywhere except the code itself.

> The tragedy is that teams recreate this failure mode faster with AI, because mutation feels cheap while understanding quietly becomes expensive. You can generate a thousand lines in seconds. But the moment you start editing those lines, you've created an artifact that can only be understood historically. You've created brittle legacy code in an afternoon.

> If knowledge only exists in the implementation, it's not knowledge. It's risk. Regeneration forces you to make the implicit explicit, or accept that it wasn't essential.

> Burn it. Regenerate it. Trust what survives the fire.
