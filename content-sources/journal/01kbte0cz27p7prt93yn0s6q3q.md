[Joshua Maponga: How to Decolonize Africa’s Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy0erq8CdSc)

> [Before school, identify problems in your community. Study them in school and find solutions. Develop a proposal and business plan. After graduating, return to your community and solve those problems.]

> [We plant coffee, which we can't eat, then export it to earn money that we can use to buy food, rather than simply planting food we can eat.]

> [Our language contains the relationship between natural entities and their functions (for example mususu helps the susu); using European names distances us from our intuitive understanding of what's around us.]

> [Our government invests in students only to have them leave to colonial economies to enrich their systems.]
