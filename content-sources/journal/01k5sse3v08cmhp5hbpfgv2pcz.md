atproto, nostr, webxdc, solid, remotestorage, and 'dApps' each have a different focus and data flow.

but i can't help but see them as collections of "web apps".

and think it'd be possible and cool to give each web app the combined user base of the others.

might not share the network, but you can share the gui.

is it naive to wish that their web apps could support multiple or all of these instead of rebuilding similar apps per platform? isn't it made of the same stuff/standards but just read/writing data differently?

when i see "writing, photos, bookmarks, todos" rewritten because "platform", i can't help but think of "5 networks of screenshots posted from the other 4".
