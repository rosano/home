[Pingu voice acting](https://bsky.app/profile/matttomic.bsky.social/post/3mcuizu4b2k2i)

> Italian voice actor Carlo Bononi was the voice of all of the characters on Pingu. A trained clown by trade, he used a theater technique called grammelot, which consists of "speaking" in a mix of babbled gibberish noises. He improvised all the voices live and unscripted.
