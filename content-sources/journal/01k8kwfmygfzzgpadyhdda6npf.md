> Marketing is the act of making change happen. Making is insufficient. You haven't made an impact until you've changed someone.

> [Marketing is the generous act of helping someone solve *their* problem.]

> Marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems. They have the empathy to know that those they seek to serve don't want what the marketer wants, don't believe what they believe, and don't care about what they care about. They probably never will.

> [Humans tell themselves stories. We should consider those as indisputably true and not persuade otherwise.]

> [Not the drill bit, not the quarter-inch hole, not the shelf, but rather the satisfaction of doing it themselves or the admiration from a spouse or a room free of clutter. Understand how the utility of an object is to serve their real wish: to feel safe and respected.]

> [We buy how it makes us feel, and there aren't so many feelings to choose from. To deliver belonging, connection, peace of mind, status, or other desirable emotions likely means something worthwhile.]
