[Welcome to Gas Town](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04)

> Stage 1: Zero or Near-Zero AI: maybe code completions, sometimes ask Chat questions
> 
> Stage 2: Coding agent in IDE, permissions turned on. A narrow coding agent in a sidebar asks your permission to run tools.
> 
> Stage 3: Agent in IDE, YOLO mode: Trust goes up. You turn off permissions, agent gets wider.
> 
> Stage 4: In IDE, wide agent: Your agent gradually grows to fill the screen. Code is just for diffs.
> 
> Stage 5: CLI, single agent. YOLO. Diffs scroll by. You may or may not look at them.
> 
> Stage 6: CLI, multi-agent, YOLO. You regularly use 3 to 5 parallel instances. You are very fast.
> 
> Stage 7: 10+ agents, hand-managed. You are starting to push the limits of hand-management.
> 
> Stage 8: Building your own orchestrator. You are on the frontier, automating your workflow.
