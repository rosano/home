[WE ALL FEEL THE TRANSITION](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heddi-ried_illustration-aiart-designprocess-activity-7424823267024060416-6iIj)

> I don't think it's the changeover itself that hurts. It's the speed. We all feel this transition. It creates a kind of thin corridor where many so-called shortcuts are currently being taken that are not really shortcuts at all. Outcomes and effects will simply be different. Efficiency is increasingly confused with impact.

i hope more people hear the call to be thoughtful in how they approach these new possibilities. with great speed, many are adopt something on shaky ground, ready to lock themselves in and throw away the key.
