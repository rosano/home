[Entropy Piano Tuner](https://gitlab.com/tp3/Entropy-Piano-Tuner)

[David Braid](http://www.davidbraid.com) told me he uses this open-source software to tune pianos in the following way:

1. Play each note to calibrate.
2. Let the software analyze and then you can preview with MIDI.
3. Adjust each strings until the feedback shows a positive result.
