> [Trusted marketers earn enrollment because they make a promise and keep it. With trust comes attention that lets them tell a story uninterrupted. The story can lead to more enrollment, more promises, more trust.]

> [Everyone is famous to 1500 people. In our culture, fame breeds trust.]

> [It takes more (stress) for a customer to say yes than to walk away.]

> [Make sure your most loyal customers have a megaphone to tell others: *people like us do things like this*.]

> [Building new things for your customers (instead of finding new customers for your things) implies investing in their lifetime value.]

> [A supermarket might expect the lifetime value of their regulars to be thousands of dollars, so they would do well to 1. sponsor events for new residents in the area and 2. do right when a local complains about the fruit not being ripe.]

> [People won't tell their friends because you wanted or asked. You need to make your offer worth sharing.]

> [Facebook during their initial growth was well-positioned as a status signal for insecure and high-status students who craved to move up in some invisible hierarchy.]

> [One kid brings a yo-yo to school but it doesn't create much traction. A charismatic fifth-grader who is good but not intimidating opens the Yo-yo Union club to all with three spare yo-yos to share; then there's three early adopters leading the way and soon there's thirty kids with yo-yos on the playground.]

> [We only notice ideas that cross the chasm beyond neophiliacs.]
