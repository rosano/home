Choosing to 'skip over parts' *is* reading because reflects a choice about is being processed.

If I've absorbed a point through my own lived experience or heard of it in another context, I'm still "reading" the idea as I recognize it well enough to skip over.

Cultural or self-inflicted frowning upon 'screens causing us to skim rather than read' creates pressure to do things 'properly', but the standard is not relevant: set your own objectives and make your own meaning.
