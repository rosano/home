[LLMs are coherence engines, not truth engines](https://medium.com/mapai/llms-are-coherence-engines-not-truth-engines-903f5209646f)

> [LLMs generate coherence more than truth, with] no access to the world, no sensory grounding, no lived experience, and no intrinsic way to check correspondence between its outputs and reality.

> [The same is true of humans, as we] construct narratives, causal explanations, identities, and moral frameworks that hang together, rather than ones that are objectively correct. [We tend towards] narrative consistency, social acceptability and reinforce biases based on beliefs.

> science works because it builds institutional scaffolding that forces grounding through measurement, replication, falsification, and peer review. Without grounding, both humans and LLMs drift into elegant nonsense.

> The risk with LLMs is not that they lie, but that they speak with fluent confidence in domains where humans already confuse coherence with truth.
