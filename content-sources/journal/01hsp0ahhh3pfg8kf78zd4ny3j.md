[So many of us throw out orange peels..](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C43A0uyrJ-G/)

> [Turn orange peels into an insect repellent for your body or plants by boiling and cooling, then strain the liquid into a spray bottle.]

> [Or peel the orange part of the peel, rinse with cold water, blend, then mix with a teaspoon of baking soda and water into a paste for a natural teeth whitener you can brush with weekly.]

> [Chop them up and use as fertilizer.]
