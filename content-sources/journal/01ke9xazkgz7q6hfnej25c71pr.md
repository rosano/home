[Puppy Wisdom, if we can hear it.](https://www.tiktok.com/@watchfulcoyote/video/7589427112398818574)

> [When a baby dog bites, it can be painful but also totally normal. Why can knowing this give me so much patience towards an animal, yet I take it so personally when my partner does something which hurts? Getting hurt and processing it together can also be a normal part of relationships, and you can't have one without the other.]
