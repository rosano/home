[yes to brag here is my stainless steel pan after making eggs!!!!](https://twitter.com/michelleakin/status/1974100494873481650)

> 1. heat the pan on high and after a few minutes drop a few drops of water into the pan. if the water sizzles its not ready. if the water forms little beads and the beads easily dance across the pan, it’s ready!
> 2. turn the heat immediately to low.
> 3. drizzle some olive oil in and move the pan to coat. then drop in a small pat of butter, then gently add your already cracked eggs
> 4. DO NOT TOUCH for at least 30 seconds
> 5. gently put a spatula beneath to see if the egg has released from the pan yet. don’t rush it, this is key! when it’s ready to move it will move easily!
