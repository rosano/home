[Is there a better word for 'hackathon'?](https://antonin.delpeuch.eu/posts/is-there-a-better-word-for-hackathon/)

> [Common hackathon activities like coding are not a good use of my time for an in-person event. I need quiet focus time and good ergonomics to do programming. Better to use these rare encounters with colleagues to chat, brainstorm, do exploratory design work for instance. I already start hacky prototypes on a whim anyway and don’t need an event do to it.]
