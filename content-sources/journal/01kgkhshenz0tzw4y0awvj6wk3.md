> every question I ask is turned into a thesis, the counter is created (antithesis). Two agents then take on those roles and the case is argued through several rounds (minimum of three, maximum of ten). A group of 12 agents then vote (with public reasoning) after each round - the first three rounds are merely indicative and there's also a zero round vote on the quality of the thesis / antithesis. 
> 
> A judging agent then decides at the end of each vote whether the arguments are materially different and if there has been a successful conclusion. Without a successful conclusion then the game continues (again there must be at least 3 rounds). Both the arguing agents have access to the argument, the counters, the voters comments and votes. Each round they present a refined argument. A court recorder summaries the thesis, antithesis, the main arguments presented and which argument eventually wins (if any does).
