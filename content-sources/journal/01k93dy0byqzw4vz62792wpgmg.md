[Cyd - Claw back your data from Big Tech](https://cyd.social)

> Backup and delete all of your tweets, and migrate them to Bluesky.

> Save a searchable copy of your data from tech platforms locally on your computer.

> Migrate your tweets from closed platforms like X into open platforms like Bluesky.

> Cyd runs directly on your computer, not on our servers. We don't have access to any of your accounts, or to any of the data in them.
