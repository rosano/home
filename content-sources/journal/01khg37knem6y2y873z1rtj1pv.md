[always bet on text](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html)

> Text is the most _socially useful_ communication technology. It works _well_ in 1:1, 1:N, and M:N modes. It can be _indexed_ and _searched_ efficiently, even by hand. It can be _translated_. It can be produced and consumed at variable speeds. It is asynchronous. It can be compared, diffed, clustered, corrected, summarized and filtered algorithmically. It permits multiparty editing. It permits branching conversations, lurking, annotation, quoting, reviewing, summarizing, structured responses, exegesis, even fan fic. The breadth, scale and depth of ways people use text is unmatched by anything. There is no equivalent in _any other communication technology_ for the social, communicative, cognitive and reflective complexity of a library full of books or an internet full of postings. Nothing else comes close.
