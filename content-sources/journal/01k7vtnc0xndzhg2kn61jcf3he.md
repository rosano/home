[Bufferland](https://www.asomo.co/p/bufferland)

> To countless low-wage employees across the world, low-cost products will seem attractive - even ‘liberatory’ - but, when you zoom out, _they are the ones cheaply producing the cheap things that are being sold back to them_.

> whenever a company is claiming to ‘democratise’ something, they’re basically saying that they will drive down costs on the production side of the equation to get the consumption side hooked on the resultant cheap thing, after which they will be in a position to extract.

> It sometimes feels like easyJet’s management presents customers with a devil’s bargain: _we’ll give you cheap travel if you agree to hand over your dignity and be treated like the crap you are_.

> When the core of your business model involves squeezing both customers and employees, it means that relations between those two camps very quickly get frayed. The stressed employee and the stressed customer are both being played by the senior management, but they often end up facing each other as mortal enemies in different parts of the system.

> Bufferland exists to provide a shallow layer of human care within an otherwise bureaucratic profit machine, but today easyJet is also using it to _recoup its losses_from yesterday’s cancelled flight.

> Companies like easyJet drive down prices through so-called ‘economies of scale’, but they also make heavy use of _Economies of Silence_: the frontline employees act as punching bags for customers, like an emotional shock-absorber, but this also serves as a system of noise-cancellation for management, freeing them from the emotional responses that would come from actually hearing the customers’ voices.
