[Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software)

> [The term "barefoot developers" is a riff on the Mao government's 1960s "barefoot doctors" initiative to train people from rural villages so they can serve as healthcare providers in their undeserved communities.]

> [Barefoot developers] are technically savvy and interested in solving problems for themselves and people around them, but donâ€™t want to become fully-fledged programmers. They still live within the world of end-user-facing applications.

> they rely on low and no-code tools. And they do wildly complex things within them, pushing these apps to their limits.

This describes my technical capacities well. Though sometimes I can surmount the "command line wall", I almost always prefer other ways.
