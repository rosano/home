# song for my teddy bear

teddy bear, teddy bear
i wanna take you everywhere
teddy bear, teddy bear
take you with me anywhere

your hand in mine or ruffling my hair
rubbing noses or twinkling stares
kiss on the forehead, the eyes, everywhere
your paw on my ear, on my heart, i swear

teddy bear, teddy bear
i wanna take you everywhere
teddy bear oh my teddy bear
take you with me anywhere

your body's a blanket,
your arms wrapped around
cozy cat cuddle in a tiny space
warm and safe under your embrace
hug, kiss, and snuggle puts a smile on my face

teddy bear, teddy bear
i wanna take you everywhere
teddy bear my dear teddy bear
take you with me anywhere

show me how to laugh
show me how to play
show me how to care, my teddy bear
your laugh, your smile, your eyes so bright
shows me the world and fills me with light

you're my bear, teddy bear
i wanna take you everywhere
be my chair, cozy anywhere
want you to be my teddy bear

everything before, everything after
it's all in your shiny black eyes
as i look in, i see the stars and the skies
nothing's beyond, let's imagine and fly

teddy bear, teddy bear
we can do anything, let's go there
love you bear, my teddy bear
thanks for being with me everywhere
