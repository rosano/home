I often say that formally studying music "broke my soul into a thousand pieces which I'm slowly putting back together again". It has been a process for me to make more music, feel comfortable with performing and improvising as well as thinking about composition. 

This performance of some improvisation and a few songs from Joyce Moreno's album [_Revendo Amigos_ (1994)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZkP1dHm1A0) symbolizes for me an evolution to a more holistic relationship with music, less affected by my own dogmas and that of the institutions I participated in, more marked by a desire to share and an acknowledgement of my own abilities and how I relate to the world.

In preparation, I used some [inner feedback loops](https://utopia.rosano.ca/inner-feedback-loops) that helped me developed a comfort with mistakes, with the sound of my voice, with my inchoate abilities on a new instrument. There is still a part of me that wants to [professionalize](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01ev1pxthspxdq5e5k5m54e1sg) everything, but it's more under control. I can enjoy this for what it is, I can own this, I can be proud of this. It's an expansive space: I have more to do here.

The music below is not completely refined and presented with imperfections, but it's a very strong message to myself that I hope to remember beyond the moment of its creation.
