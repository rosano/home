I'm making a QR code generator and scanner that works offline:

* no accounts ✅
* no popups ✅
* no customization ✅
* works offline ✅
* download as SVG or PNG ✅
* scan via camera or files ✅
* rounded corners ✅

It's designed to be a simple, pain-free way to quickly create codes that look nice. Will eventually be possible to save in a collection and sync across devices…

You might use it to create a QR code for event links, social media profiles, Wi-Fi access, contact info. Someday, I hope to incorporate custom icons.

To break with tradition a bit, this is unfinished and will be shaped by feedback from people who use it; would love to hear what you think.
