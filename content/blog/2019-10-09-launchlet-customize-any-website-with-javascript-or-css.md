I'm super excited to share **Launchlet** <https://launchlet.dev> \- my first project that integrates with remoteStorage. It's a javascript/css launcher that you can run as a bookmarklet, browser extension, or module in your own project.

There is a compose interface for managing your _Recipes_ and it uses remotestorage.js + a custom storage widget. It's so nice to be able to work offline, sync between different devices or prod/dev environments. I wish remoteStorage was more well-known and adopted everywhere because it makes the whole app and dev experience so much simpler.

Any feedback is welcome. Let's make more of these apps!!
