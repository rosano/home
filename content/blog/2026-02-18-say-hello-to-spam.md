I thought it would be fun to share a special public email address to feed hungry bots:

sayhi@rosano.ca

Anything sent there gets instantly reported as spam. To do this in Fastmail, you first make an [alias](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360060591073-How-to-set-up-aliases), then a [rule](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000278122-Filters-Rules#newrulesettings):

It only took a few clicks to create. Maybe if enough people did this, email spammers might flag themselves out of existence?

I imagine it might be better to:

- put it in source code or somewhere no human would look for contact information
- use your own domain, as plus addressing like `+hello` reveals your main address
- sound plausible (like dictionary words) and not random letters/numbers

Try to get creative so that it's hard to pattern match. Here's another one:

eatme@rosano.ca
