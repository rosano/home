title: Note-ifying all the things (with Boris Mann)
summary: Notes are inescapably chronological
---
I just had a fun conversation with Boris about note-taking, the overwhelm of tools, and future possibilities. Hints at some changes I might make in the way I've done things for the last years.

> [Notes are inescapably chronological, even without organizing as a (b)log. Everything is written in the context of one's personal development, or in terms of history, or as humanity evolves—nothing is really devoid of time.]

This was somewhat spontaneously recorded, and prompted from a random thought I had about how effective graph-based note-taking apps are.

Fascinating to see how Boris writes in his own journal to detail conversations and thoughts…
