I've never really written a song with words before.

This one sort of came to me on a plane, thinking about and missing my partner who I wouldn't see for a few weeks.

Fragments of a melody, some words, and verses, arriving persistently in random order.

Even on an overnight flight, I was too excited to sleep observing this unfold.

It felt simply like listing "things I felt" or "things I wanted to say", and then [applying note-taking reflexes to making music](https://utopia.rosano.ca/applying-note-taking-reflexes-to-making-music/): putting related bits together, sorting and massaging text, tweaking for rhymes and musicality, moving undecided elements to a recycle pile.

I often like to describe this as 'writing without magic' and it's nice to see it happening with a song.

I'm happy with how this turned out and hope you'll enjoy.
