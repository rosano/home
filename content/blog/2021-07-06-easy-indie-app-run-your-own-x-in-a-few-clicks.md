After [brainstorming](https://talk.fission.codes/t/are-there-synonyms-for-self-hosted/1976) there now exists a page for [Easy Indie App](https://easyindie.app) which promotes the idea of self-hosting via ‘one-click install’ systems like [Cloudron](https://www.cloudron.io), [Caprover](https://caprover.com), and [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org). Any feedback is welcome and [the code is open-source](https://github.com/0dataapp/easyindie).
