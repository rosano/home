Divide social activity in digital spaces into two categories: _discussion_ and _reference_.

Most activity is _discussion_: news or blog updates, shared links, forum discussions, microblogging hot takes, comments, private or group messages, livestreaming, newsletters. They speak to a particular moment in time.

Examples of _reference_ can include: wikis, git repositories, project documentation, question/answer sites or FAQs, indexes. These resources are not directly concerned with specific moments in time — they attempt to be organized according to context and relevance.

_Discussion_ begins to fade the moment it is published. It can be temporarily revived (bumped) by some kind of activity or update, but this itself is a form of _discussion_ that begins to fade on arrival.

The effect of this 'fading' is that whatever was gained through discourse becomes more difficult to find with time, as newer content takes precedence — the reverse-chronological organization of most technology makes things [designed to disappear](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01etag49zpy2jz472n6zyba998), and **digital systems generally do not remind us that there is a cost to keeping things forever**. [Technology is inconsiderate](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01etwewt0hsf6z5cgm3j1w4409).

Combat this ephemerality by

* capturing ideas into _reference_ as often as possible
* deliberately making older content less accessible
* warning about any false sense of findability

Something needs to be lost, there must be some cost to keep things around. As an example, an [engineer at Stripe talks about](https://www.derrickreimer.com/essays/2019/05/17/im-walking-away-from-the-product-i-spent-a-year-building.html) how

> they automatically delete chat messages older than a few weeks to discourage relying on it for long-term archival. In retrospectives, team members often reflect on whether they chose the right medium (email, chat, or forum) for various conversations.

_Discussion_ is necessary for exploring possibilities without friction. _Reference_ gives longevity to the results.

| send a quote of an article to a friend or post it on your timeline      | compile similar resources and build a larger idea from small disparate pieces |
| search for an idea by scrolling through a reverse-chronological archive | browse by context and stumble upon something related but unexpected           |

The [Wikum](http://wikum.csail.mit.edu) project is a web-based platform that integrates discussion and collaborative summarization.
