I'm motivated to start a newsletter again, after being out of it for some years, and mix the approaches I've tried so far.

Currently feels fun to try quarterly (Occasion-al) updates about things I've experienced, published, or encountered; it's inspired by a private one from [Nathan Hewitt](https://hew.tt), as his seems to be about connection and a kind of life and online digest.

From publishing [Ephemerata](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01f58x4bdpm6530ba58wxjm30w), I learned that I enjoyed the sharing, ritual, and weirdness—as did other people—but weekly is too much for me, and maybe monthly too.

My posture has shifted from "I should take as little space as possible because I'm probably not worth your time" to "I'd like to connect regularly with people who like what I'm doing, want more, and expect the unexpected".

Would also be nice to have one newsletter for a change and not several. Perhaps the nature of a [secular church](https://utopia.rosano.ca/secular-churches-for-continuity/) is that it serves many interests unevenly at different times, but remains worthwhile for all.

If you'd like to try this with me, see the most [recent edition](https://rosano.ca/occasion/1/) or just jump in and [subscribe](https://rosano.ca/occasion).
