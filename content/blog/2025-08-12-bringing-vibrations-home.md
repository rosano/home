I'm starting a process to collect my online publishing across various platforms into one 'home'.

Music was the easiest to setup because it doesn't involve dealing with existing systems of mine.

You can see what it's like at [rosano.ca/vibrations](https://rosano.ca/vibrations).

# Vibrations

It's hard to have an overview on YouTube as they only show things in upload order, and also separate some videos into 'Shorts'.

By contrast:
1. I now have everything on one page,
2. videos are ordered based on my actual chronology,
3. and some even show the [recording date](https://rosano.ca/vibrations/m305fu7c).

It's crazy to perceive the psychological impact of no platform, no ads, and no random obfuscation of my work: I can browse and experience in peace.

# metadata details

One thing I find cool is how I can derive the local time and place of any post with [my travel data](https://github.com/rosano/home/blob/master/assets/departures.csv).

Every page also has a "Source" link to view the original file (like the one for [this post](https://github.com/rosano/home/edit/master/content/blog/2025-08-12-bringing-vibrations-home.md)). A reader can easily correct something, or add tags if it makes sense.

And the there are [direct social media links](http://rosano.ca/vibrations/m4879q4m/) saved from crossposting with [n8n](https://n8n.io) or manually.

One last detail is that I've mixed these with log entries to see them in a richer time context; see [2024](https://rosano.ca/log/2024) for an example of how this mixes together.

My inner librarian really gets excited by this sort of thing. I love information density, organizing things a certain way, and the potential to fill in more details as time goes on; I would like this site to become a very precise opinion about how that should be.

Might be worth mentioning that this is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which seems to always have an elegant place for things to rest; I described some of the features I used on [their forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/music-vlog-powered-by-hugo/55632).

It feels cool to see so many parts of fragmented systems coming together. With search engines becoming increasingly hostile toward finding things, these approaches remind me of older internetting ways: links that don't break, having multiple ways to discover things, openly accessible without ads, and maybe owning more of your data.
