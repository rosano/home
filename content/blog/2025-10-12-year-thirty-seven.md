For my thirty-seventh year, I wanted to write a shorter annual reflection, so here are some important layers since last year, followed by something I'm currently sitting with that feels profound to me.

*1. affirming experiences, celebrating myself, [from scrolling to strolling](https://rosano.ca/blog/where-am-i-scrolling).*

*2. love and relationship with my partner as we spent time in Germany, Dubai, India, Kenya, and Portugal.*

*3. food, cooking, eating, tasting; untold amounts of dosa, chaat, shredded cheese, fried sandwiches and crispy things; many days started with masala chai*; happy to discover uji power

I'm immensely grateful to have found a sense of place again with my projects. My [questions from last year](https://rosano.ca/blog/year-thirty-six/#more-questions-than-answers) have answers, and something is emerging, not sure what.

I find myself deeply in the zone.

Most days, all I want to do is get back to it.

It's immensely satisfying even if I'm the only person I know that might consider it relevant.

Focus, reps, optimistic vortex, strong signal, ripple effects.

Just keep going, keep building.

I understand my technology toolset at a level higher than I've never known; I [no longer fear the docs](https://rosano.ca/blog/dont-fear-the-docs/), and it gives me greater control over my materials.

Looking ahead, I just want to put my head down and make progress. Let's see next year where it takes us.
