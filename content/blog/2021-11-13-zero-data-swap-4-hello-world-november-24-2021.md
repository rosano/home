We're going to present 'the simplest possible integrations' for the various protocols. [Noel De Martin](https://noeldemartin.com) has already started a [Hello World for SOLID](https://github.com/0dataapp/hello-world-solid). [Rosano](https://rosano.ca) will try one or both of remoteStorage and Fission (although a volunteer for either would be _very much_ appreciated). Be welcome to join us and ask questions: let's learn together.
