[Improvisation, Spontaneity, and Oneness](https://interintellect.com/salon/improvisation-spontaneity-and-oneness/)

What can various traditions of non-duality teach us about being spontaneous? What makes someone a good improviser? What makes for a good experience on improvisation? How much do improvisers plan? Is it something that is “manufactured” or simply “channeled?” Can improvisation be a portal into an experience of shared consciousness?

Let’s talk about improvisation in comedy and music, and how to encourage more spontaneity in life.
