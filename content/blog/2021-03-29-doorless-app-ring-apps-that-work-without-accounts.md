I'm starting a webring for web apps to support 'no-login' projects. It can be like the ones featured on <https://tinytools.directory>, or even server-side information resources like <https://searchmysite.net> or <https://0data.app>. It just means 'someone can show up and start using it immediately'.

Anyone working on projects like that is encouraged to [join by making pull request](https://github.com/0dataapp/small-web-app-ring#add-your-projects-to-the-ring).
