I'm starting to train capoeira again with some new groups and thought to reflect on how many different places I've done this.

My accountant brain enjoys a good spreadsheet, so it naturally manifested in this list:

{{< capoeira-visits >}}

I'm not sure how to make sense of time versus experience. 

My first class was on December 13, 2021, which amounts to about 4 years ago at time of writing, but regular training in groups and solo during that time probably amounts to about a year and a half.

But also some training is more impactful than others, so what is the best measure of experience here?

I think about two quotes.

One is "Do you have ten years of experience? or ten of the same year?" which I heard from [Jess Martin](https://www.devtools.fm/episode/78?view=TRANSCRIPT).

It can certainly be valuable to have a broader perspective from diversity of experiences, but, alsoâ€¦

when it comes to the body, maybe there's more potency to practice Bruce Lee's [single kick 10,000 times](https://twitter.com/brucelee/status/1304344053216096256).

I'm far from good at this, and as with other aspects of my life, my skills would be deeper if I stuck around and solidified a kind of 'base'.

I do like how this shows an aspect of how I travel to [connect with people rather than tourist attractions](https://utopia.rosano.ca/strolling-across-the-usa-october-2023/), more-so than my [list of cities](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01gp32jrgtec4jbvdw6gr9592h); Mestre Mago told me it shares the idea that capoeira lets you [feel familiar in unfamiliar places](https://strolling.rosano.ca/0174/).

I definitely value meeting so many great people, and feel grateful for being welcomed into so many places to be part of the movement, music, and camaraderie.

Someday I'll have a nice game I can share. For now here's me practicing and singing on my own.

If you're interested to learn more or try capoeira, there's probably a group near you even though it's invisible to most people. Here are some games I like:
