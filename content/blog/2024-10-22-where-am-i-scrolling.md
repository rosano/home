My video about [scrolling meme platforms](am I scrolling?) talks about how random unrelated bits and pieces can leave you confused.

Here I wanted to talk about the scrolling aspect, as I have my own interpretation of this and am trying to become more aware as I do it.

If 'memes' are the content, 'scrolling' is the permission you give to be subjected to one unrelated thing after another without much choice.

'Scrolling' is constantly changing the channel: useful to have an end point, not sure it's conducive as a default mode of operation.

It can also happen while walking down a street full of commercial things designed to get your attention: 'huh, look at this shiny object', 'ooh, that place has a sale', 'yum, this seems tasty'.

It doesn't even have to be about shops: I notice my attention on pigeons gathering, car drivers getting into arguments, judgements about people's clothingâ€¦

I say I'm 'scrolling' when I don't realize my attention is bouncing between these things, when the channel changes are the main event

There's nothing wrong with having attention on any of those things, but I'm noticing a similarity between how I scroll online and how I jump between things in the real world.

In the same way I would prefer to choose where my attention goes online, I would like to have that kind of choice offline: to choose to be absorbed by random things walking down a street, or not.

More and more, I prefer to observe where my attention goes, and at least to be aware when random things appear to be the main event.

From watching the screen to watching myself watch the screen.

Scrolling to strolling.
