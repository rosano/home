i'm beyond excited to present to you my (second) foray into podcasting, which i call Strolling. i published a trailer last week to describe it, but i wanted to wait until the first episode before sharing with everyone, and it's finally out <https://strolling.rosano.ca/0001>

can't wait to do like fifty of these. the process feels really wholesome and i'm using it to provoke me into making music. although i'm producing it solo, the result is fundamentally a collaboration and i'm glad to finally incorporate more of that in my work.

hope you'll enjoy this ride. i'm sitting on the saddle of a star today.
