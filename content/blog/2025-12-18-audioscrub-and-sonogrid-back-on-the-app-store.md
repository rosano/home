I wrote in [going fully web](https://rosano.ca/blog/going-fully-web/) about my reasons to take them down and, although I continue to feel similarly, was recently convinced by [Heddi](https://ried.studio) to consider restoring them there.

Here's what motivated me:

1. People who previously paid for them could not get a copy for new or other devices. I thought this would be possible even when not officially on the store, but it turns out to be more complicated than that. After contacting those who had issues about this years ago, many quickly replied back with very visible gratitude to have access to AudioScrub again; seems it still fits their needs better than whatever else is available.

> yes!!!!! Thank you🎉🎉🎉 Still the best one out there 

> Thanks so much for communicating this to me. I’ll pass the word on to friends and  colleagues who I know will benefit greatly from these 2 apps.
> I myself use these apps daily, as it helps the learning music process greatly!

> That’s amazing, congratulations! And thank you for letting me know, I really appreciate it.

> I will definitely try it today on my iPad. I love your app.

> Hello, so great to see your music app again!

> i have already bought it !! Thank you very much. A nice Christmas present.

2. I worked hard on these and remain quite proud of them; not sure if it accomplishes much to nuke my history in the way that I did. Even though they were built for another era, everything still works great and I've never stopped using them.

3. It's been quite a puzzle to create income from pure web apps with my ideal structure of [no personal data stored or collected](https://0data.app), [no login or signup to start](https://rosano.ca/blog/going-doorless/), ideally [open-source](https://github.com/rosano/rosano/blob/master/README.md). While I figure out how to make that sustainable, it's helpful to have some other income streams.

No plans to update these for the moment, but I think it's a good step to keep it available.
