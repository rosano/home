Let’s listen to music together and talk about how it affects us.

# Summary

We did a few rounds of spontaneously selecting music to share based on where the conversation was. After listening collectively, we talked about how it makes us feel, why we feel connected to certain songs, other context related to the music itself. We heard a variety of genres in three languages and allowed ourselves to be surprised. Some people shared reaction music to other people's selections. Some of us brought instruments to play/sing.

# Some takeaways

* chords and music theory might seem mathematical, but they can become a language that affects us emotionally.
* there is hope in always having something new to discover, to hear the unexpected in something you're familiar with.
* music can offer a healthier way to connect with more primal emotions like anger and rage.
