My journey towards independantly creating iPhone apps was not straightforward. I tried on at least five occations over the period of a few years to learn how to do it and always ended up blocked in the process, not coming away with an understanding of how the system works. I started with years of experience in web programming but was not able to transfer much of the knowledge: the web uses technical concepts invented in the 1990s whereas native apps require different paradigms from 1980s that are more primitive and complex. I ended up collaborating with [Wil](http://www.flagpig.com) to create my first app that helped in the process of learning and transcribing songs, leaving the programming to him while doing everything else myself.

Still wanting to unravel the mystery, I continued thinking about the next attempt. Something clicked on the sixth try. At some point I became aware of an unexplored path and decided to pursue it to create the most basic prototype possible: an app that does nothing, but that functions as a [proof](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01eyk25j1enps0xcmq9ntdcrz5) of getting the pieces working together. After succeeding with this, I proceeded to make another naive one that only stores and edits data: the underlying blocks of most actions that people perform with apps. Finally, with a better lay of the land and an understanding of how to compose from the available parts, I managed to realize an idea that had been nagging me for a while: a remote control for the system music app that lets you spontaneously start learning the song that's currently playing, without needing to 'create a project' or 'import'â€”to seamlessly transition from casual to deep listening.

Almost a decade later, I have managed to create half a dozen apps on my own. It's hard to remember what it was like to not know how to do this, but I know that at the time I had no idea what was what, feeling I would never figure it out or that it's something that 'smart people' or 'trained people' could do. It's a lesson in patience, perseverance, and allowing time pass to help digest ideas and put things in perspective.
