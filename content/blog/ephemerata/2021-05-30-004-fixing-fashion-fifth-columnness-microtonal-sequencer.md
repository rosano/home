Welcome to the fourth edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I’m doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

# FIXING FASHION

The Precious Plastic team has started [another recycling revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buWRaffBdNM), this time to reduce clothing waste. The call to action in their launch video is to wear repaired cloths and help turning patches and repairs into a statement—proud to be DIY.

They have started a series of well-produced videos showing how to avoid unnecessarily purchasing new clothes. In 15 minutes they cover [removing stains with natural ingredients, sorting clothes properly, creating your own detergent, washing, drying, and storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWFuBTWjg4w).

I find the idea of [upgrading your old clothes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO9VlYliXcU) most compelling: make them smaller or larger; re-make new clothes by combining old ones; recolouring using natural ingredients (like avocado and cabbage); and decorating adding interesting patterns, pockets, buckles.

For those more comfortable with needles or Singers, there is a video on [how to fix common problems yourself with a machine or by hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxGHRlevlQ).

Also, (a quick detour back to their original Precious Plastic project), they use their globally popular open-source machines to make [flowerpots, mountain climbing clip, a lamp shade, a hand blade for surfing from disposable masks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5pkleCwb%5FY)!. They claim that 30 billion masks are thrown away per month, each containing similar materials to plastic bottles that take 500 years to degrade.

# WARDLEY MAPS (via [@boris](https://talk.fission.codes/t/crossing-the-river-by-feeling-the-stones-google-cloud-next-2017/1941))

_For nerds of business, tech, data visualization, and map-making._

This [dense presentation explaining the creation and use of visual maps to surface adoption strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek0aWj%5FrWYs&t=183s) features lots of information and graphics to outline a framework for future planning.

It’s a multi-layered cake that you likely don’t want to eat in one sitting. If you survive the barrage and would like to learn more, Simon Wardley has written [nineteen chapters on Medium about this method](https://medium.com/wardleymaps), and a related [community for mapping](https://www.map-camp.com) offers workshops to learn collectively.

The visual slides are the best part, but as I avoid images here I will only share some quotes:

> \[Things that evolve and become more efficient enable higher-order systems to appear.\]

> \[New ages don’t start with their first prototypes, they start at the industrialization and commodification of systems.\]

> \[By sharing maps we discover that we are building similar things elsewhere.\]

# HUMANITY

Therapy contemplation of the week:

> \[The purpose of a conversation is to help the river flow again.\]

---

An isolated community in Kenya with no fiat money created their own [system of trading that doesn’t rely on cash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojFPrVvpraU). This video documents the creation of their secondary currency, the institutional resistance, and some principles of how to make it work.

> \[Allowing popular retailers to become banks creates a profit motive for debt, which reduces trading because people are not able to pay expensive loans. Introducing a secondary currency enables people to trade which deteriorates debt as a profit strategy.\]

> \[The community knows what’s best for them. They can back their own money.\]

---

Beau of the Fifth Column puts his fifth-columnness to the test by [talking about a war without talking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eedJCa-62c). He supremely demonstrates how to approach a divisive topic without succumbing to slogans and talking points.

> \[The truth cannot be told, it has to be realized.\]

> \[Whataboutism is proof that people believe something is true across all systems.\]

> \[Those who are in power benefit from slogans, not from context.\]

For anyone with the stomach to read it, I published [an English translation of my recent encounter with the Brazilian police](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01f6srp7b67f2pe06bk7dqk9y1).

# TECHNOLOGY

Damien Clarke’s [Xenpaper](https://xenpaper.com) calls itself a ‘text-based microtonal sequencer’: using numbers and symbols you can produce a simple scale or complex melodies with sophisticated timing. A rare ‘text-to-music’ system where the demos work and are fun—you can just click the play buttons and observe how the sound corresponds to the text.

# LANGUAGE

I can’t wait to learn German one day so that I can understand and perhaps use the [words from this thread](https://twitter.com/rose%5Fpereira/status/1397566300646518786?s=21) (via [James](https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/796098598541459487/847469612605374475)):

> \[**Kummerspeck**: excess fat from emotional overeating, translates literally to ‘grief bacon’ or ‘sorrow fat’, and similar to ‘muffin tops’ in English\]

> \[**Weltschmerz**: feeling so tired of worldly evils that it’s painful to exist\]

> \[**Verschlimmbessern**: trying to improve something but eventually making it worse\]

# FOOD

Adam Ragusea explains [what mushrooms exactly are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkaJoIIBAVA) (they’re not plants or animals…). Feature some wild footage of something growing in a basement. (via [@kevin@merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@kevin/106302140756011707))

# MUSIC

**All the following items can be accessed as a** [**one-click playlist via Joybox**](https://go.rosano.ca/ephemerata-004-music) **without accounts or sign up—just open and play.**

[![Playlist](https://static.rosano.ca/joybox/_JBXPlaylistButton.svg)](https://go.rosano.ca/ephemerata-004-music)

This ‘spiky’ [avant-garde jazz from Berlin](https://punktvrtplastikintakt.bandcamp.com/album/somit), released earlier this year by PUNKT.VRT.PLASTIK, features vague meters and uneven clocks. I also grooved hard to the slightly steadier [_Nuremberg Amok_](https://punktvrtplastikintakt.bandcamp.com/track/nuremberg-amok) from an older album. (via [James Ball](https://jamesballmusic.bandcamp.com))

This [lovely little bossa nova for kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn0n6sjSOFo) (apparently going viral on TikTok, which I don’t use), comes from The Backyardigans, which is [a show where every episode features a different music genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FBackyardigans)! Wish I grew up watching that… Adam Neely does a [deep dive into the music theory devices employed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAGjfFmFkw) in the song. (via [matheus23](https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/791374365018947644/847462455906009088))

Two things from musical master Jacob Collier, but not really about the music: 1) [dance animations created from the spinning of a vinyl disc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue6g7SPSyAM), and 2) he [spells out words by playing the piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LszYGO22azA&t=126s). The latter is something that normal humans accomplish via a lengthy editing process on the computer—he performs it live.

---

Swaya’s [remix of _Where They At_ by Acemo](https://swaya.bandcamp.com/track/acemo-where-they-at-swaya-brazilian-girlsx2-edit) is our body-shaker of the week. The original comes alive with African percussion, echoed synths, and a stronger rhythmic drive.
