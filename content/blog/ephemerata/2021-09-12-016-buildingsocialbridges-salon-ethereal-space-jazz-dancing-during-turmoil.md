Welcome to the sixteenth edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting, and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

# BULIDING SOCIAL BRIDGES

On Saturday, September 18th, I‚Äôm hosting my second Interintellect salon, [Building Social Bridges and Healing a Divided World](https://twitter.com/interintellect%5F/status/1435450993236320256), which will be a group discussion about cultivating connection across divides. I think it‚Äôs useful to discuss this at the moment and would like to learn from other people‚Äôs experiences. If you can‚Äôt make it and have tips, learning materials, good examples, please share. Let‚Äôs learn together :).

By coincidence, I recently heard [Buster Benson talking about his book, The Art of Productive Disagreement](https://twitter.com/ideamarket%5Fio/status/1435274128148217859):

> \[Being civil or skirting around hard topics isn‚Äôt enough.\]

> \[Disagreement is usually more about values than facts.\]

> \[Make predictions and see what happens. Now there‚Äôs nothing to argue about, everyone learns something, and it creates a ritual to reconnect.\]

# THOUGHTS WHILE DANCING DURING TURMOIL

> Converse with the music.

> All music teaches.

> Even without controlling externalities, you can be absorbed in your experience of being alive, you can take care of yourself, you can connect with your body. In _that_ world, we are free.

# STARTING NEW APPS

I recently recorded [Scaffold an app from scratch](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01ff0er2s74hz51w3pph9rm2ay): a live coding video where an existing app is used as the basis for a new one. You can see the steps I go through each time I have a new project and get an idea of the different aspects involved. This is hopefully the last ‚Äòlong video‚Äô and followed by small live coding videos on specific topics.

## Ethereal space jazz

Sam Gendel and Sam Wilkes‚Äô [_Music for Saxofone and Bass Guitar_ (2018)](https://leavingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-saxofone-and-bass-guitar) is full of strange and wonderfully creative sounds, beatboxing, and melody-less improvising, all of which were recorded live with something like loop pedals. I really dug the mouth percussion and head-banging stank face grooves on _THEEM AND VARIATIONS_; as well as the beat from dental fricatives on _GREETINGS TO IDRIS_. The inconspicuously-named _TRACK ONE_ has this remarkable throat falsetto riff and manages to build a movement-inducing rhythm that simultaneously feels sparse and full-bodied, drizzled with a solo of quartal explorations on thirteenth chords.

## Albums

Jorge Ben‚Äôs [_For√ßa Bruta_ (1970)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbRXXWySMeft4ELA9r0lYV1maIU9748aw) mixes complex harmonies with Brazilian dance rhythms, orchestra with folk instruments, and is generally a good time. (via [we fucking love music](https://wefuckinglovemusic.blogspot.com/2015/01/jorge-ben-forca-bruta-1970.html))

This [compilation of music sung by Mildred Bailey (1930s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9mKlYNI3IY) features some lovely stride jazz piano. My first time hearing this singer. (via [Brian Ginsburg](https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/791374365018947644/885666684470456370))

## Tracks

Hania Rani recorded a [live set of music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFRdoYfZYUY&t=432) which makes me want to play the piano again. At various points she plays while touching the strings to create percussive sounds. The set merges electronic and acoustic, and she also sings on some tracks. It‚Äôs always special to see people pushing the boundaries of live music-making. (via [@ghostlevel@merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@ghostlevel/106857225144112727))
