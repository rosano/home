Welcome to the seventeenth edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting, and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

# SALON TAKEAWAYS

The [#BuildingSocialBridges salon yesterday](https://cafe.rosano.ca/t/building-social-bridges-and-healing-a-divided-world/129/2#summary-1) was effervescent. I feel happy with how deep we were able to go, and grateful that the participants were so generous in sharing ideas. I encourage anyone who couldn‚Äôt make it to read the notes, as each person brought some special wisdom to the conversation. Here are some of my favourite ideas:

> ‚Äú\[Creating connections is the core of being human‚Äîit‚Äôs so natural for children.\]‚Äù ‚Äî Alessandro

> ‚Äú\[Prefer shared language over common ground.\]‚Äù ‚Äî Jeeva

> ‚Äú\[Divided people may share smaller beliefs. People with similar conclusions may have surprisingly different values. A world where everyone agrees has no room for evolution. Unpack the belief into values and decisions to find common ground.\]‚Äù ‚Äî Jessica

> ‚Äú\[Secular people _do_ have faith (in the conversation, in the day getting better, in the world doing well, in human potential), so it‚Äôs not a big step to jump to spiritual.\]‚Äù ‚Äî Tristan

# MOWGLI‚ÄôS MONEY

Brett Scott [compares economic self-sufficiency with interdependency](https://brettscott.substack.com/p/money-through-mowglis-eyes) using Tarzan and Mowgli as metaphors (via [@delta\_chat@twitter.com](https://twitter.com/delta%5Fchat/status/1436950258366484483)):

> \[The Tarzan suite analyses from the fully-formed individual onward: the nodes make up the network. The Mowgli suite starts from interdependence and a child that needs to be cared for: the network makes the node.\]

> \[The idea of passing a random stranger on the street did not exist in the past, as survival implied being part of tightly-knit groups.\]

> \[Nation states are only about 5000 years old and have dissolved the boundaries between smaller collectives to create ‚Äòthe public‚Äô, which we are vaguely connected to, but do not know.\]

> \[The image of ‚Äòprehistoric wilderness man‚Äô we consider today is a caricature. Primitive life was not ‚Äòsolo men creating shelter and hunting‚Äô but intensely group-oriented collaboration, as can be seen in photos of indigenous tribes.\]

> \[The myth of self-sufficiency assumes that interacting with others and trading is optional, as opposed to a mandatory means of survival.\]

# MAKING COMPUTERS FLEXIBLE

Alexander Obenauer‚Äôs [Why is our thinking on computers so restrained?](https://alexanderobenauer.com/weekly/20210626) describes the inflexible aspects of apps, interfaces, files, and digital taxonomy. These are thoughts about how human-computer interaction could be more natural, and how to personalize the experience, from someone who is apparently building their own operating system.

# THE PURPOSE OF FRIENDSHIP

The School of Life produced a video [framing friendship according to four different purposes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGedUxTAfBk): networking, reassurance, fun, and thinking. I find it useful as a way to notice when relationships don‚Äôt enrich us or fit into these purposes, to prompt finding more clarity about the connection.

# ‚ÄòBOY‚Äô IS TROUBLE

Beau of the Fifth column talks about [why the seemingly innocuous word ‚Äòboy‚Äô is avoided in the southern United States](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmReupLUvDE), and posts a breathtaking followup for someone asking [advice on how to handle it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apn6wXIO--4).

# THE SWEETER THE BERRY, THE OLDER THE HAND

I learned of a French expression ‚Äò[sucrer les fraises](https://www.expressio.fr/expressions/sucrer-les-fraises)‚Äô, literally ‚Äúsugar or sweeten the strawberries‚Äù, which refers to the tremor of an elderly person‚Äôs hands. Why? Because in order to enjoy strawberries, one needs to take a bowl of sugar and shake it gently from side to side, coating evenly to perfection before eating.

# BIENAVENTURANZA

Chancha Via Circuito‚Äôs [_Bienaventuranza_ (2018)](https://chanchaviacircuitomusic.bandcamp.com/album/bienaventuranza) is an old favourite reverberating inside me the over last few days. I have never forgotten my first impression from hearing this years ago: the feeling of a wide-open space gradually expanding, physical heaviness (as if this were a solid object) created from sparse texture. This digital cumbia from Argentina has a certain rawness from traditional instruments and especially the voice, combined with natural ambience, and electronic sounds. (via Roberta)

## Bites

Sam Gendel‚Äôs [_When I Am Laid In Earf_](https://samgendel.bandcamp.com/track/when-i-am-laid-in-earf) from _Fresh Bread_ (2021) pairs baroque harmony and voice-leading with a computer-generated voice on autotune. Hella eerie.

Nate Wood‚Äôs [_It‚Äôs Enough_ (2021 single)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InOoRRXS9ps) from the _fOUR_ project is one person playing drums, bass, and synth in 5 meter, while singing, plus ‚Äúrecorded live in 1 pass with no overdubs, click track or pre-recorded backing tracks‚Äù. What else??
