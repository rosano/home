Welcome to the sixth edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

Special thanks to [Brian](https://brianginsburg.com) and [Elisa](https://linktr.ee/elisanemrima) for being the first contributors [to my Open Collective](https://rosano.ca/fund) last week üôÇ.

# ABO SAHAR (ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿ≥Ÿáÿ±) (via [Amr Yakan](https://www.facebook.com/amr.yakan/posts/3863703147012282))

This musician and producer from Egypt has a vibe that I would describe as ‚Äòbadass mofo‚Äô. His music touches various genres including disco, trance, hip-hop, while referencing elements of traditional Arab music.

In a [feature video by El Fasla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QoXc9s2yQ4) he describes growing up in a rural area where there were no instruments and figuring out how to make sound out of anything, like blades of grass. Some choice quotes from the clip:

> I play at weddings and no one leaves until I unplug the cable.

> I have a better night than the groom.

> This is called the White House, for when tourists or foreigners are here.

Check the music playlist at the end for various tracks of his that I enjoyed.

I learned that _Music for Robots_ from [last week](https://cafe.rosano.ca/t/87) was designed for and performed on [actual robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkUq4sO4LQM). For anyone curious there are [more explanations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MluikyEQF4) and [a paper on robotic drumming](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/comparison-of-solenoid-based-strategies-for-robotic-drumming.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.2007.188;format=pdf).

# LANGUAGE

Brian Wiles is an actor from New York City who speaks excellent Egyptian Arabic and made videos [explaining American culture to the Arab world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf5E0nHAjRY) and [comparing Arabic with Mandarin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoKcNqy1lG0).

Observe the beauty and poetry in these [Persian forms of address](https://twitter.com/PersianPoetics/status/1401489663907483648)

> When a Persian speaker turns their back they say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry my back faces you.‚Äù  
> The other person replies: ‚ÄúA flower has no front or back.‚Äù  
> Then the first person might say: ‚ÄúA songbird sits behind a flower.‚Äù

Reminds me of how Arabic speakers say ‚Äògood morning‚Äô by wishing you a ‚ÄúMorning of light‚Äù, to which the other person can reply by wishing ‚ÄúMorning of flowers‚Äù.

# LAUGH

This animated series about [a four-eyed musical spider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEY8IulWiA&list=PL9J5NQm3fP%5FgcCl05uhwW7wfdp%5FaOyD9T&index=6) is one of the cutest, most entertaining things I‚Äôve ever seen. Short minute-long episodes that humans of any age would love. Impossible to stop watching, but the playlist is finite. (via Dani)

Eric Floberg‚Äôs [minute-long _Every Youtuber in 2021_](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x1HIkBEi9uY) has a beautifully meticulous build up to the punchline.

# MUSIC

**All the following items can be accessed as a** [**one-click playlist via Joybox**](https://go.rosano.ca/ephemerata-006-music) **without accounts or sign up‚Äîjust open and play.**

[![Playlist](https://static.rosano.ca/joybox/_JBXPlaylistButton.svg)](https://go.rosano.ca/ephemerata-006-music)

Three tracks by Abo Sahar (ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿ≥Ÿáÿ±):

* [_Trobby Asly_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIxotba-5d8) from _2020_ (2020) featuring so-called ‚Äòtrobby music‚Äô, not sure if this is a reference to trap music, but it‚Äôs gritty, noisy, hypnotic‚Äîmay give you stank face.
* [_Mizmar Abosahar_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD3qOdp%5FG5Q&list=OLAK5uy%5FnOa4Jr%5Fqh1-LcYA06-L6GEAamVk3qOMTU) with the piercing ornamented tones of a traditional music instrument that appears in some Greek music (similar to a duduk), although I think it‚Äôs synthesized here.
* [_Moulid Kholkhal (ŸÖŸàŸÑÿØ ÿÆŸÑÿÆÿßŸÑ)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atD%5F5FqZig&list=OLAK5uy%5FmtpBAGAuEOgeCiuPE9iktwklS42-cm8Mg) with Arabic microtonal melodies, electronic effects, [shaabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaabi) rhythms.

Ana Vidoviƒá plays an [hour-long concert of classical guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e26zZ83Oh6Y&t=185s) with works by Bach, Brouwer, Scarlatti, Albeniz.

---

meu amigo tigre‚Äôs [_treta_](https://youtu.be/YYhcpZ8xMMU) (2020) is self-described ‚Äòdrama rock‚Äô in Portuguese. Feels inspired by Frank Zappa sometimes. I like the diversity of complex textures on this album. There‚Äôs also birds!

Jacob Collier delves into music nerdery, showing how it‚Äôs possible to [harmonize any note with every chord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItVo8XN1wXI&t=52s) or [how a diminished chord lets you modulate to anywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpXXwCQEFTc&t=47s).

Tolgahan √áoƒüulu [modified a classical guitar to play microtones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRsSjh5TTqI&t=150s) and demonstrates with an excerpt of a Turkish melody.
