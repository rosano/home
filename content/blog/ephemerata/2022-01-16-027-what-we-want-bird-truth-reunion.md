Welcome to the twenty-seventh ceremony of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata): reflections, observations, and life at the edge.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting, and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

Thanks to Mark Segger for [becoming a backer](https://rosano.ca/back) this week ‚ù§Ô∏è.

# WHAT WE WANT

When it isn‚Äôt possible to both make money _and_ do something meaningful, I‚Äôve always opted for the latter. In [What we want](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01fsf9z4d1yq29sk00y32w1ynm), I attempt to understand the reason for this:

> Why is it that when confronted with the choice between ‚Äòpopular and profitable‚Äô or ‚Äòesoteric but meaningful‚Äô, I always take the hippie route and just do what makes me happy(, man)? Why is my primary motivation generally creative expression or being original, despite coming at the cost of my financial comfort? Is it just my millennial urge to be a unique snowflake? \[continued‚Ä¶\]

# PODCAST COMING SOON

Almost finished editing the first episode. I‚Äôm usually excited when releasing new projects, but my measurement meters are overloading on this one. Can‚Äôt wait to see how and where this goes: <https://strolling.rosano.ca>

# ASIDES

[The Truth Behind ‚ÄòBirds Aren‚Äôt Real‚Äô](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1dXuMEpT0). I was really hoping this would last forever, but it‚Äôs good that the guy can move on with his life and get closer to his family. This ‚Äòhit job documentary‚Äô is a fascinating look behind the scenes at the movement‚Äôs origins‚Äîfeels kinda deep to be honest. Going to miss this important example of what‚Äôs possible when people come together.

> \[Embodying lunacy can be a way to express the absurdity of reality.\]

> \[People participate without even realizing.\]

> \[Everyone acts and plays their role, but there‚Äôs no rehearsal.\]

I had a day of bingeing funny videos last week and went through some of [Chris Fleming](https://twitter.com/ChrisFluming)‚Äôs little skits. Had some good laughs with [uncle or famous?](https://twitter.com/chrisfluming/status/1480950747940331525), [Halloween Candy Countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-In-JeLuguI), and [Teens Who Drink Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRiRrpd%5FVDQ).

[Punctuation in novels](https://scribe.rip/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4). Visualizing texts by frequency of their punctuation marks. I‚Äôve always been a fan of data visualization, especially condensing an entire work into a single graphic to facilitate comparisons. I did this once when studying Hindustani music by transcribing an improvisation and mapping out which notes of the raga were used and how they were approached (laborious but interesting to look at). Curious to try this on my own writing some day to know what it ‚Äòlooks‚Äô like. (via [Alexei](https://twitter.com/AlexeiGalux))

Notes from a mystic:

> Your seeking creates a smoke around the flame. You go on running around and around, you stir much dust, and you create much smoke, and it is your own effort that stirs the dust and creates the smoke, and the flame becomes hidden. Rest a little, let the dust settle back to the earth. And if you are not running very fast, not in a hurry, you will not create smoke. By and by, things settle and the inner light is revealed.

## Short

[Bobbie Gentry: _Reunion_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBl4YQMoBKk) from _The Delta Sweete_ (1968). Complex interleaving of multiple parts with folksy Southern USA accents. Listen to the percussive clapping, bass drum, and guitar on the left channel, with voice and trumpets in the right channel. Reminds me of Moondog. (via [Debora Ipekel](https://worldwidefm.net/episode/debora-ipekel-with-poly-ritmo-28-03-19-2))

[Israel Fern√°ndez: _Fiesta (Buler√≠a)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l4fAqc7u-Y) at COLORSxSTUDIOS (2021). The simplicity of a powerful voice accompanied by delicate clapping and feet hitting the floor, heard in stereo. Even without understanding the lyrics, one can appreciate how the fierce singing cuts through your prefrontal lobe. An example of making music with the body and whatever‚Äôs around (the desk might have been my primary instrument for years). As an aside: there‚Äôs too much good music on this show, and I would appreciate recommendations. (via [Brian Ginsburg](https://brianginsburg.com))

[Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith: _Rare Things Grow_](https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/track/rare-things-grow) from _EARS_ (2016). Mishmash of many exquisite textures: water glugging, saxophone flutters with delay and reverb, possessed drone voices, quartal harmonies, celestial singing, some shakers in just the right places. Hinting at indigenous musics through instrumentation and motifs, but unapologetically electronic, jazz, and modern. The cover art might be a good metaphor for how this strange and beautiful thing makes you want to keep staring, or listening.

## Two oldies gems (via [Pat Power](https://twitter.com/patpowerpck))

[The Dixie Cups: _Chapel of Love_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwJYXBsc7g) from _Chapel of Love_ (1964). Super soulful vibe created from vocals, bass, horns, glockenspiel, drums, and clapping‚Äîfewer ingredients than ice cream.

[The Everly Brothers: _All I Have to Do Is Dream_ (1958 single)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbU3zdAgiX8). One of the first things I played in public on the piano when growing up; the harmony fits perfectly in one hand and can be pretty satisfying to repeat for hours‚Äîgreat way to learn about thirds and sixths.

## Bites

[Ornette Hawkins: _Raw Sun Live Sessions_ (2018)](https://soundcloud.com/ornettehawkins/raw-sun-live-sessions). Live jazz-infused drum and bass from an artist with a killer name.
