Welcome to the thirteenth edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting, and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

# LANGUAGE

[The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com) is a beautiful Tumblr documenting made-up words describing difficult feelings. My favourite [‚ÄúP√¢ro: The Feeling That Everything You Do Is Somehow Wrong‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7l2hUp0CkQ). (via [Tani](https://twitter.com/inattani)):

> **agnosthesia**  
> _n_. the state of not knowing how you really feel about something, which forces you to sift through clues hidden in your behavior, as if you were some other person‚Äînoticing a twist of acid in your voice, an obscene amount of effort put into something trifling, or an inexplicable weight on your shoulders that makes it difficult to get out of bed.  
>  
> **midding**  
> _v_. intr. feeling the tranquil pleasure of being near a gathering but not quite in it‚Äîhovering on the perimeter of a campfire, chatting outside a party while others dance inside, resting your head in the backseat of a car listening to your friends chatting up front‚Äîfeeling blissfully invisible yet still fully included, safe in the knowledge that everyone is together and everyone is okay, with all the thrill of being there without the burden of having to be.  
>  
> **Altschmerz**  
> _n_. weariness with the same old issues that you‚Äôve always had‚Äîthe same boring flaws and anxieties you‚Äôve been gnawing on for years, which leaves them soggy and tasteless and inert, with nothing interesting left to think about, nothing left to do but spit them out and wander off to the backyard, ready to dig up some fresher pain you might have buried long ago.

## Music and Emotion Sharing Circle

[Yesterday‚Äôs salon](https://cafe.rosano.ca/t/114) was fun as we listened to a range of different styles; a great dose of healthy serendipity to my music intake. Two songs stuck with me.

Lingua Ignota‚Äôs [_PENNSYLVANIA FURNACE_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YRMV7ffPpY) from _SINNER GET READY_ (2021) is filled with dark piano textures, and a strong, pure vocal tone that manages to create this deep and expansive intensity with just a few parts. Reminds me of how powerful the acoustic piano can be. You can hear the pedals of the piano triggering overtones‚Ä¶ (via [Zsolt](https://twitter.com/zstorok))

Lil Jon and LMFAO‚Äôs [_Drink_](https://youtu.be/cVxqiP0N1B4) from _The World‚Äôs End_ soundtrack (2013) is a body-shaker, head-banger, wall-breaker‚Äî100% energy using cues from techno song forms. I have some nostalgia for Lil Jon‚Äôs general screaming and expletives. Moving! (via [Jeeva](https://twitter.com/jeevajay))

## Azymuth

[_Light As A Feather_ (2012)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl1X0iD82a4) is a complex yet danceable mix of jazz, fusion, and disco. Makes me feel like digging into Azymuth‚Äôs entire collection. _Partido Alto_ has a funky offbeat rhythm that‚Äôs actually in 4; _Avenida Das Mangueiras_ stomps along‚Äîdriving pulse with funk sixteenth note solos; the second section of _Light As A Feather_ mixes jazz and bossa nova brazil with an uber-tight drum foundation; _Fly Over The Horizon_ reminds me of Weather Report; _Jazz Carnival_ goes full on disco; _Young Embrace_ is a bouncy, swaying electronic biological thing, obviously from Brazil.

The drummer from their band joined with Madlib to form ‚ÄúJackson Conti‚Äù and release [_Sujinho_ (2008)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIpSLfKeKh8): jazz/hip-hop instrumentals mixed with pandeiro and all sorts of Brazilian instruments and rhythms, Coltrane-era sax solos, synth riffs, flute melodies‚ÄîI‚Äôve never heard anything like this.

## Albums

Joyce Moreno & Toninho Horta‚Äôs [_Sem Voc√™_ (2007)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy%5FlfismXxPdnHknJZvB8OdYDAJhoHKobh2g) features two of my favourite artists in Brazil (or perhaps the world) on the same disc. Two masters playing samba, bossa nova, jazz, sublime guitar.
