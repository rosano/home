I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting, and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

# ARRIVING HERE

Since arriving here three weeks ago, I‚Äôve been enjoying my time with the [Moos](https://moos.garden) collective, meeting lots of cool people with interesting projects and ideas, and hearing tons of funky music around which I hope to share. For the first time in a while, I have a feeling of being not so online and spending time around mostly ‚Äònot internet people‚Äô‚Äîlearning lots, stretching myself, understanding collective living, finding my own rhythm within this context to be creative and productive. I‚Äôve always wanted to be in Berlin and am super grateful for this opportunity; hope to stay a while longer.

# STROLLING

I changed the podcast format to publish shorter bits and more spontaneously, as there‚Äôs not enough time to have a two-week editing ceremony for each interview. Although I miss the music, I‚Äôm happy with the result so far and think it‚Äôs more digestible. What do you think?

## Short

[Jacob Collier: _Don‚Äôt Stop 'Til You Get Enough_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC3GrzoQG9U) (2018 single). Overlays himself with a grand piano that can loop, re-creating the vibe of Michael Jackson‚Äôs original using purely acoustic sound. Wild funky solo and lush harmonies as always. During the [halfway point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC3GrzoQG9U&t=147s) he goes into a time signature that I can‚Äôt figure out; anyone know? (via Ahsen)

---

[Michel Camilo, Anthony Jackson, Horacio (El Negro) Hernandez: _Calle 54_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU-sjnoC0uw&t=238s) (2000). An excerpt from the documentary about Latin jazz featuring some ways of playing the piano I haven‚Äôt seen before. The beginning more resembles something you might hear elsewhere, but I‚Äôm starting at the [mid-section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU-sjnoC0uw&t=238s) which has some very intense improvising with Latin rhythms. Impossible to sit still as they have too much fun creating this from nothing. (via [Lars](https://www.larsschmidt.org))
