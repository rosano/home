# STROLLING

Finally launched my podcast last week after describing with a [short trailer](https://strolling.rosano.ca/0000).

The [first episode](https://strolling.rosano.ca/0001) features Judy Perly, who has been running a Jewish restaurant and folk music venue in Toronto for over 40 years‚Äîwe had a wide-ranging conversation that touched on recipes and expertise, giving people characters, creative funerals, and much more. I ended up making some music in the process too.

Feedback so far has been generally positive and curious for more, which I take to be a good sign.

# APPS DISAPPEARING SOON

[My iOS apps](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/rcreativ/id356609408) are currently free and will disappear from the App Store in February 2022; read [Going fully web](https://ephemerata.rosano.ca/01fmeehzvr3n9q0rkrnf7y2d5c/) to understand why. Download before they‚Äôre gone to avoid eternal regret.

[Hear - Advanced Listening](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hear-advanced-listening/id1087530357). An app that listens to your environment, adds filters, plays it back to you via headphones in real time. Filters include ‚Äòrelax‚Äô (drone in the background higher frequencies turn into water dripping), ‚Äòhappy‚Äô (as if raining and everything is echoed with long decay), ‚Äòsleep‚Äô (combination of waterfall or white noise and echoes the environment); each filter has various levels that can be customized. Fun to play with, regardless of whether it actually helps you chill out or doze off‚ÄîI‚Äôm curious to try them with more intention. (via [Beat](https://beatrixe.space))

Notes from a mystic:

> \[Bliss is just a word: you can desire it but not know what it is. Only one who has tasted it can give it to you, and without doing anything: from their presence alone the unknown flows toward you.\]  
>  
> \[A master is an availability, not a teacher. A teacher may not know, having perhaps learned from other teachers. A master gives you a taste.\]  
>  
> \[A great teaching doesn‚Äôt give you instructions for doing, as it is concerned with your being.\]

I had the privilege of attending a [Musical Potluck](https://interintellect.com/salon/musical-potluck-beginnings/) for Interintellect members, and would like to share some of my favourites:

* [Clogs: _Kapsburger_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdxmCRYuNDM) from _Lantern_ (2006). Pure instrumental bliss in this journey that lasts just two minutes. Simple harmonies on guitar that surprise by shifting with subtle voice-leading (often changing one note of the chord at a time). There might be hints of Bach in here, or maybe I‚Äôm just projecting what I want to hear. (via [Kasra](https://twitter.com/KasraKaley))
* [Amit Trivedi: _Shubhaarambh_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DpA6Imc97M) from _Kai Po Che !_ (2013). Soundtrack for a Bollywood film, with lyrics in Gujarati. The introduction has a strong time feel without any rhythmic accompaniment. There‚Äôs bagpipes (!), and I know how odd it might be to feature that in Indian music, but the duduk-like instrument called ‚Äòshehnai‚Äô went right to my heart. (via [Vivek](https://twitter.com/vivekt17))
* [Lisa Hannigan: _What‚Äôll I Do_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvwJMa5b1Qg&t=2s) from _Passenger_ (2011). Starting hook got my attention right away. Bright, sunny vibes created with vocals, strings, bass, percussion, and clapping; some of it would normally feel clich√© to me, but I enjoyed this. The constant offbeats create a deep swing effect: your body will move. (via Daniel)
* [Murali Coryell: _Softly Let Me Kiss Your Lips_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuLptKfRedQ) from _Eyes Wide Open_ (2000). Prepare yourself for nine minutes of ‚Äòstank-face inducing‚Äô blues vocals, guitar solos, lush organ chords, straight on the triplet drums, scatting‚Ä¶ Imagine starting your day with this.
