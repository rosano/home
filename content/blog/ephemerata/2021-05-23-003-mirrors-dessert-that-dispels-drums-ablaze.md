Welcome to the third edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I’m doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

# HUMANITY

Short pithy contemplation of the week:

> Fools don’t trust mirrors.

---

A short anecdote about [why this Cohen was supposed to be a Katz](https://twitter.com/tchotchkele/status/1395146144213209089), related to why one father from Gaza recently traded his children.

---

Trevor Noah mixes funny with serious [talking about Israel-Palestine](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NeZ4yXyzUG0):

> \[Religion has never calmed down a situation when there’s a clash\]

> \[Israel has a giant Mutombo in the sky knocking down rockets\]

> \[What responsibility comes with power?\]

India’s Golden Temple community kitchen [has been feeding 100,000 people per day since the 1500s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT-N5wl0l-s). The video describes quantities, costs, routines, division of labour involved in preparing massive batches of rice, potatoes, lentils, bread, tea and desert. (via [@grey](https://merveilles.town/@grey/106259291819900882))

Beau of the Fifth Column talks about [burning out from helping those in need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vrk2vWeQUk).

---

Christopher Butler’s [_Think About the Future’s Past_](https://www.chrbutler.com/think-about-the-futures-past) reflects on our relationship with time—on how we connect our current self to a potential self:

> Our selves inhabit a world like that not as a contained body moving through space, but more like a worm whose dimensions are defined by time. Our posterior, the past; our middle, the present; our head, the future. His turn of phrase, “the long self,” is, as it turns out, quite literal.

# LANGUAGE

At some Istanbul/Greek weddings, guests receive a dish known as [“f\*\*\*-off pilav”](https://twitter.com/NektariaAna/status/1392808890434265089) when the hosts want them to leave. Reminds me of the Brazilian practice/superstition of [leaving a broom behind the door](https://rioandlearn.com/brazilian-superstitions) to tell guests you don’t want them around now.

---

Folha de S.Paulo showcases [various Portuguese accents from Brazil and beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uFkciZLnNU).

---

Zé Felici made a [Brazilian Portuguese IPA chart](https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=461047257665356&id=100012802561168&set=a.121686114934807&source=57) based on the popular [English version](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/40/92/e940925a70d38d8e5db889ed0059bcc0.png). (via Dani)

In the search for the previous chart, I stumbled upon a fascinating infographic visualizing [variations of slang interjections with religious origin](https://www.facebook.com/prosasdeminas/photos/varia%C3%A7%C3%B5es-da-express%C3%A3o-nossa-senhora-em-minas-gerais/2128207820561116/). The way the words morph might be particular to Brazilian, but I wonder if similar transformations exist in Québec French. Est-ce qu’il y a un.e québecois.e sur la liste avec un indice?

---

An [Egyptian sign language course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw44A1185uc&list=PLaQzmDaYayMCuW3Y0LhKnYON8u5%5FQQYsW&t=364s) given in Masri. (via [@Stoori@polyglot.city](https://polyglot.city/@Stoori/106257153443942134))

# TECHNOLOGY

Stephen Diehl details [how cryptocurrency scales ransomware to new heights](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1395687848230199296.html).

Means TV describes itself as [“the world’s first worker-owned, post-capitalist streaming service.”](https://means.tv/pages/about).

How people used to connect to the Internet: [using a rotary dial phone and shoving the handset into a modem](https://twitter.com/chrisfralic/status/1394069922469326848).

# LAUGH

Comedian Drew Morgan shares his hilarious theory about [how slavery in the United States led to the southern accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LObreREaixg).

Mondo Mascots documents [prolific creativity in Japanese mascots](https://twitter.com/mondomascots/status/1393940124749033475).

# MUSIC

**All the following items can be accessed as a** [**one-click playlist**](https://go.rosano.ca/ephemerata-003-music)**.**

[![Playlist](https://static.rosano.ca/joybox/_JBXPlaylistButton.svg)](https://go.rosano.ca/ephemerata-003-music)

Tariq Harb plays [Bach’s _Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565_ on guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jtuTCy8RXg)—a challenge translating this piece from organ keyboard to six strings. Classical music on this instrument is one of the most sublime things.

---

This [funk carioca body-shaker](https://youtube.com/watch?v=%5FP7S2lKif-A) blasting at home signalled my friend’s long-awaited scheduling of a COVID vaccine. I dig the music, and it has gotten over a billion views, but the video hurts your eyes. Featuring samples of Bach’s _Flute Partita in A minor_.

---

I’ve never seen such fiery [dance choreography by someone in a wheelchair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHUJ0ZWUgfY&t=184s). (via [Romain](https://www.facebook.com/romain.morin.355/posts/10165122951090635))

---

Three tracks in a row from [Bandcamp Weekly #450](https://bandcamp.com/?show=450) stopped me. Jaubi’s [mix of jazz, raga, and rock](https://jaubi.bandcamp.com/track/raga-gurji-todi), Yellow Spoon’s [minute-long drum amen break escapade](https://yellowspoon.bandcamp.com/track/octopus), and Athletic Progression’s [high-energy vortex non-stop fire drumming](https://athleticprogression.bandcamp.com/track/osaka).

---

If you liked the pygmy hockets from [last week](https://cafe.rosano.ca/t/002-prescription-apps-preaching-to-the-choir-improvised-freestyles/74#music-5), check out Meara O’Reilly’s [_Hockets for Two Voices_](https://mearaoreilly.bandcamp.com/track/i). In these exquisite duets with herself, she manages to create a diversity of moods using only the sound of her own voice.

---

Lovely Latin jazz with congas and cowbells from Cal Tjader’s [_Complete Concert By The Sea_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmCj2HBZA1Q).

---

I always love receiving music. Send me recommendations anytime, anywhere!
