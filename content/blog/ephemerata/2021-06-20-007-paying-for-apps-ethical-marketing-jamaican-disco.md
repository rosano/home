Welcome to the seventh edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting, and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

Thanks to ‚ÄòLawrie‚Äô (AKA my dad) for contributing [to my Open Collective](https://rosano.ca/fund) this week üôÇ.

# PAYING FOR APPS

[The latest episode of Metamuse](https://museapp.com/podcast/32-pricing) is a comprehensive overview of issues around software pricing. They discuss sustainable business models, data ownership, trade-offs of using app stores, the importance of letting people try the app first. Might be a worthwhile listen for anyone wondering why many apps are moving to subscriptions.

Some useful concepts for me:

* The term ‚Äúmodern living app‚Äù expresses how apps need regular maintenance and are never ‚Äòfinished‚Äô. To ‚Äòsell it and forget it‚Äô is unrealistic and so is charging for it once.
* The concept of ‚Äúalumni mode‚Äù is about making sure people have access to their data even if they cancel their subscription. I demoed this in my [funding button](https://vimeo.com/500628067#t=15m23s) earlier this year, and I‚Äôm glad to have a short name for the idea.

> \[Consider the psychological goods as well as the commercial ones (community, social signaling, ambience).\]

> \[One does not simply change the price: they need to rethink the product, marketing, analytics, testing, support, etc‚Ä¶ It might be useful to have a dedicated pricing person, in the same way as designer or engineer.\]

For even more discussion, check out [their episode with the creator of Agenda](https://museapp.com/podcast/25-time-based-notes), which goes into the dynamics of producing apps as an independant developer, and engaging with your community.

My [upcoming event with Fission on July 8th, 2021](https://talk.fission.codes/t/building-zero-data-apps-entrepreneurship-with-rosano/1999) around ‚Äúearning a living from apps without holding other people‚Äôs data‚Äù will also get into these topics, so please join us if you‚Äôre interested.

# ETHICAL MARKETING

I‚Äôve been rediscovering Plausible Analytics this week. They wrote about [all the marketing practices they _don‚Äôt_ use](https://plausible.io/blog/best-marketing-practices):

> Don‚Äôt confuse marketing with advertising, spamming and shoutingWe don‚Äôt do any paid advertisingWe don‚Äôt use spy pixels from Facebook and Google to retarget youWe don‚Äôt track your every click using session recordingsWe don‚Äôt do any exit popups and other intrusive calls-to-actionWe don‚Äôt have affiliates and don‚Äôt pay anyone to recommend usWe don‚Äôt do A/B testing and other experimentsWe don‚Äôt try to get you on a sales call to test our productWe don‚Äôt have a fancy email sequence to ‚Äúnurture‚Äù you into payingWe don‚Äôt try to engage you after you sign up for our productWe don‚Äôt use a chatbot or an AI-tool to engage and convert youWe don‚Äôt ask you to join yet another webinar to learn some secretsWe don‚Äôt participate in any link buying to game search enginesWe don‚Äôt have a podcast and a video channelWe don‚Äôt know who you are, what you like or where you‚Äôre fromWe ignore all other unethical proposals we see in our inbox

Respect for making a more conscientious option profitable.

They also describe some [noble properties of open-source software](https://plausible.io/blog/building-open-source):

> Open source is software that you can trustSoftware that is ethicalSoftware with more earnest goals, motives and principles other than profit making and shareholder valueSoftware that tells you what it does upfront, direct and honest.Software that is open and transparentSoftware that you are a user of rather than a product ofSoftware that is created by real people rather than faceless organizationsSoftware that can be verified that it does what the creators say that it does

# HUMANITY

Some fundamental thoughts from [Jessica Alonso](https://twitter.com/jessicamalonso/status/1403433535969497088) around psychological defenses (via [the Female Rivalry salon](https://interintellect.com/salon/understanding-women-female-rivalry)):

> \[Every baby has cried and been scared of being abandoned.\]

> \[We‚Äôre hard-wired to avoid rejection and abandonment because it‚Äôs directly linked to our survival.\]

> \[Be loving and accepting, and undo any false sense of scarcity that has been created.\]

# TECHNOLOGY

Guess who said this:

> I‚Äôd like to do my part in encouraging a return to longer forms of thinking and writing, which provide more room for nuance and more opportunity for establishing consensus or, at the very least, respecting a diversity of perspective and, you know, science.  
>  
> I want to revive the original spirit of the older, pre-commercial internet, with its bulletin boards, newsgroups, and blogs ‚Äî if not in form, then in function.

# LANGUAGE

Love in [English versus Persian](https://twitter.com/PersianPoetics/status/1404793314876878850):

> In English we suddenly ‚Äòfall in love,‚Äô but in Persian love comes in stages: First the ‚ÄòhavƒÅ‚Äô (infatuation) of youth, then the ‚Äòd≈´stƒ´‚Äô (affectionate love) of a couple, followed by the ‚Äòeshq‚Äô (passionate love) of newlyweds, and finally the ‚Äòmohabat,‚Äô (caring love) of an old couple.

# LAUGH

Been getting into Ze Frank‚Äôs inimitable videos again and found his [Guide To Candy Trading after Halloween](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLNplefdGKo). His series on obscure biological creatures (such as [killer surfing snails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVWQCd5j%5Fec)) can be fun in moderation.
