# DATING APPS

Writing about my first experience [using apps to meet people](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01fmkad2j6gtxtx0hhedse2s3k):

> For most of my life, I have not been so open to the idea of using technology to find romantic relationships. Coming from a culturally conservative background, dating itself could only happen under‚Ä¶

# BRIAN LOVIN‚ÄôS PORTFOLIO

His [personal portfolio](https://brianlovin.com) has some affordances to make it interactive like a web app, and participatory like a social network: people can [ask anything](https://brianlovin.com/ama), comment on [writing](https://brianlovin.com/writing) or [bookmarks](https://brianlovin.com/bookmarks), say [which apps they use](https://brianlovin.com/stack). There are also some ‚Äòevergreen‚Äô resources like this [digital security checklist](https://brianlovin.com/security) and [app dissection blog](https://brianlovin.com/app-dissection).

Demonstrates that we can construct spaces for community within a context that‚Äôs often highly individual, and without asking people to create accounts (sign in with Twitter, data stored on Firebase); like a purpose-built room with specific and relevant activities.

Hosting one‚Äôs own ‚ÄòAsk me Anything‚Äô reminds me of Pat Metheny‚Äôs [Question and Answer](https://www.patmetheny.com/qa/questionViewAll.cfm).

Would be nice to have RSS feeds for each ‚Äòtype‚Äô as opposed to for writing only. The list presentation is unfortunately [Designed to disappear](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01etag49zpy2jz472n6zyba998).

See the [source code](https://github.com/brianlovin/briOS) for how it‚Äôs made.

# ASIDES

I usually don‚Äôt find good musical metaphors for people coming together to do things, but I love this one: (via [Friendships, Scenes, and Growth salon](https://interintellect.com/salon/friendships-scenes-and-growth))

Notes from a mystic:

> \[Seek and you will not find, because seeking strengthens the ego.\]

> \[When you‚Äôre hollow like bamboo and the divine lips are on you, you become a flute and the song starts.\]

> \[A child who holds their father‚Äôs hand neither trusts not doubts: they are undivided, not missing anything.\]

Listening to [Justin Jackson‚Äôs Indie Bites interview on Bootstrapping Transistor.fm](https://www.bites.fm/bootstrapping-transistorfm-to-13000-podcasts/) made me realize the importance of balancing your resources with the trajectory you pursue. It changed a perspective I‚Äôve maintained for a while of ‚Äúavoiding things that are overly commercial because there‚Äôs something superficial about that‚Äù; I‚Äôm still not so motivated by money, but feel more inclined to follow a path that isn‚Äôt purely about ‚Äòthe idea‚Äô. I found it provocative to think that ‚Äú\[it should be easy to become financially successful as an indie hacker\]‚Äù and make sustainability a priority. Also important to take into account the mental health cost of taking risks over a longer period: better to pick opportunities that can have some kind of return within a year or two‚Äîany longer and you‚Äôll need more material resources and likely a strong support network to keep your mind in balance.

> \[It‚Äôs uncommon for successful entrepreneurs to ‚Äòstart from zero‚Äô: they likely have experience, connections, skills, or a financial runway that provides the conditions to take risks.\]

> \[If it takes longer to get to a sustainable income than you have runway, the market fundamentals might not keep you afloat.\]

> \[A mental health balance is an important part of your runway when taking on something as stressful as indie hacking.\]

## So Good

[Kidi Band: _So Good_ (2021)](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/album/so-good). Has lots of cool things that I like in jazz and indigenous music, but as if an indie rock band did it. There are stereo effects, hocket-like devices, odd meters, and highly rhythmic singing throughout. So many tracks with an individual charm: the polyphonic ending of [_Mary (Merry)_](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/track/mary-merry) with crunchy harmonies; [_Burn It Up_](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/track/burn-it-up)‚Äòs intricate interlocking rhythms in multiple voices with wild vocal bending, all in a five-meter polyrhythmic time feel; [_Man of Endless Motion_](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/track/man-of-endless-motion)‚Äòs heavy head-banger groove, again in five-meter, with cascading interlocking vocal interjections; the incessant intense rhythmic vocals in [_Free Will_](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/track/free-will); [_Ingomar_](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/track/ingomar) is like a complex Rube Goldberg machine that sings in seven; [_Go On_](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/track/go-on) has a wicked African three-against-two time feel; [_Across the Sea_](https://kidiband.bandcamp.com/track/across-the-sea) lilting triplet feel, pleasant yet precise.

## Long

[Pat Metheny Group: _Secret Story_ (2007)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy%5FlbC67F5HW6BDd4-oKrAdch4jT1L7T6Ddo). Eclectic sonic materials throughout that resemble the album cover‚Äôs collage, yet it all seems to belong together. There‚Äôs always emotion and sentiment despite compositional complexity. Generally enjoyed the cinematic moments, mood of the 1970s, and the mixing of orchestra with electronic sounds. My favourite moments: an interesting vocal texture to start the album in [_Above the Treetops_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=OLAK5uy%5FlbC67F5HW6BDd4-oKrAdch4jT1L7T6Ddo&v=XtyyqGxflAs); the sound of a sitar played like a guitar in [_Facing West_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=OLAK5uy%5FlbC67F5HW6BDd4-oKrAdch4jT1L7T6Ddo&v=XtyyqGxflAs); the raw earthy vocal scatting and hard sever-meter groove in [_Finding and Believing_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=OLAK5uy%5FlbC67F5HW6BDd4-oKrAdch4jT1L7T6Ddo&v=W09nqybuhek); the high-energy vortex soloing environment, abundance of lush harmonies (typical of Metheny‚Äôs music) in [_See the World_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=OLAK5uy%5FlbC67F5HW6BDd4-oKrAdch4jT1L7T6Ddo&v=FdaL9vLCzGs).

## Short

[Little Simz feat. Obongjayar: _Point And Kill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvY31eN3gtE&t=46s) from _Sometimes I Might Be Introvert_ (2021). Makes body move, and if your eyes are open, the visuals are sublime. Words and rhythm fit like a glove. Feeling an unapologetic artistry through fashion and music. Concludes with a sudden change to African instruments but with the same time feel. (via [Elena](https://www.facebook.com/une.individu/posts/10159366581081070))

[El Masreyeen (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ±ŸäŸäŸÜ): _Bahebek La (ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ®ŸÉ ŸÑÿß)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBc1Al4w64I) from _ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ®ŸÉ ŸÑÿß_  
(1977). The warmth in this funky disco gem from Egypt goes straight to your shoulders. A simple composition with slight contrast between sections, yet it stays interesting throughout. ‚ÄúI love you, no; I need you, yes.‚Äù (via [Debora Ipekel](https://worldwidefm.net/episode/debora-ipekel-2))

## Bites

[Sam Gendel: _Cold Duck Time_](https://samgendel.bandcamp.com/track/cold-duck-time) from _Satin Doll_ (2020). space hyper jazz bebop swing squeal sax glitch loop vibe. The rest of the album is comprised of quirky interpretations of jazz standards.
