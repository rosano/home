Welcome to the fifteenth edition of [Ephemerata](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata), a weekly-ish digest of links, ideas, learnings, and sounds that I think are worth sharing.

[![Subscribe](https://static.rosano.ca/_shared/_RCSSubscribeButton.svg)](https://rosano.ca/ephemerata)

I‚Äôm doing this to stimulate discussion around what I find interesting, and also to share things before they disappear into the void of my journal.

# HOME AGAIN

I‚Äôm back in Canada after a long moment in Brazil. The journey here was pretty chaotic (see [How my one-way flight home with United cost an extra $4200](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01fet3jqpndfhxksyt1v872w5h)) but now I‚Äôm at home, in quarantine, catching up with music and friends. This is a good week to reach out as I would appreciate company.

# ZERO DATA ON THE RUNTIME PODCAST

Last week, I had a great [chat with Rafael Kennedy](https://chat.0data.app/t/zero-data-on-the-runtime-podcast/34) about Zero Data apps, the different protocols, what it‚Äôs like to build for this platform, and trade-offs compared to traditional designs.

## Blood and Dust

Blood and Dust‚Äôs [_Rites of Blood and Dust_ (2020)](https://blood-and-dust.bandcamp.com/album/rites-of-blood-and-dust) is so far away from what I normally listen to that I needed to look up the genre in Bandcamp (it says ‚Äòambient ritual ambient atmospheric horror dark ambient drone horror drone melodic dark ambient queer Montreal‚Äô). I often struggle when listening to music that calls itself ambient because I tend to find it sort of ‚Äòempty‚Äô, but this was very clearly not the case here. Many tracks have this tasteful way of shifting the meter from a ‚Äòthree‚Äô to ‚Äòfour‚Äô feel, or gradually building intensity, or contrasting between arhythmic and groove, textural and instrumental. _In the Hollow of a Hill_ somehow works in a flute and maybe a cello‚Ä¶ This is not passive listening but a sound experience that‚Äôs well put-together: I recommend hearing from start to finish.

## Albums

Fikret Kƒ±zƒ±lok‚Äôs [_Zaman Zaman_ (1993)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOP8MwvFE7nNjCmn-Yl8lRKv8GbMulSnD) chills me out, quiets me down‚Äîmusic to sway. This Turkish rock singer creates an old sentimental sound using acoustic instruments. My favourite is _Oysa Ben_ with looping chord progressions, sounds of the shore, vinyl scratching, seagulls. Nice also to hear the warm piano on _ƒ∞ki Par√ßa Can_. (via Clara)

This album by Kasai Allstars, with the spectacular title [_In The 7th Moon, The Chief Turned Into A Swimming Fish And Ate The Head Of His Enemy By Magic_ (2008)](https://kasaiallstars.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-7th-moon-the-chief-turned-into-a-swimming-fish-and-ate-the-head-of-his-enemy-by-magic), features traditional sounds and singing by Congo-based musicians mixed with modern production techniques. If you dig this, check out the Nihiloxica from [#014](https://cafe.rosano.ca/t/014-rethinking-analytics-nihiloxica/123#music-5). Lots of groovy, funky bits where I found myself practicing Rich Brown‚Äôs modal improvisation tips from [#012](https://cafe.rosano.ca/t/012-hard-bossa-cellular-communities-modal-improvisation/111#bites-8).

Steve Lacy‚Äôs [_Raps_ (1977)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdThNPEAo0A) is beautiful chaos from one of the free jazz greats: plenty of clashing notes, disjunct rhythms‚Äîeverything‚Äôs broken as it should be.

## Tracks

Pino Palladino and Blake Mills‚Äô [_Chris Dave_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Kpf8JIIDA) from _Notes With Attachments_ (2021) is grooooooovy, jazzy, funky, with intricate clicking and clacking, and water glasses played with a violin bow. (via [@dokoissho](https://merveilles.town/@dokoissho/106798277980398718))
