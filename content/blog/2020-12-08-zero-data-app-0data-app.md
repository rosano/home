After [brainstorming](https://community.remotestorage.io/t/non-technical-names-for-unhosted/648) there now exists a page for [Zero Data App](https://0data.app) which aims to have a non-technical explanation of ‘unhosted’ as well as a user-friendly app directory that includes apps from the RS wiki, the Solid project, and the unhosted project. Any feedback is welcome and the source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/0dataapp/0data).
