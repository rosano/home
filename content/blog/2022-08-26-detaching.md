title: detaching from online life
---
i've been less and less online since coming to berlin in march, and recently shared why in [Strolling episode 0080](https://strolling.rosano.ca/0080). haven't had enough time to write that i haven't had enough time. so much has changed in the last five months and i look forward to see where everything goes.

the podcast is the only thing i'm regularly doing online at the moment and people seem to volunteer positive feedback. if you want to get a sense for what it's like, check out [my snazzy random clip generator on the front page](https://strolling.rosano.ca). last time i emailed was for the launch and there have been lots of lovely moments since then.

sharing links i've encountered currently feels like an older version of myself, so i decided to merge the ephemerata list here. time to focus on travelling, life, music, movement, and making the most of my experience
