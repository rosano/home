Since 2023 I've been recording piano music from my past. This is one I learned in my second year of university.

Music is often considered subjective, but I'm not sure how wide the spectrum is to label the emotions around this one. Would anyone call this light-hearted? I would consider it more dramatic or intense.

The ways of creating 'crunch' here have definitely fed into my improvisation; I think it's an approximation of the beautifully imprecise blue notes we can effect more easily with the human voice, compensated for this instrument made of buttons.
