If music was the only contribution to this world from capoeira, we'd still be quite rich for it.

if music was the only contribution to this world from capoeira, we'd still be quite rich for it. this is barely one song of a thousand, happened to be in my head the last days.

quando eu morrer, me enterre na Lapinha
calça culote, palitó, almofadinha

adeus Bahia, zumzumzum, cordão de ouro
eu vou partir porque mataram meu Besouro

zumzumzum é Besouro
zumzumzum cordão de ouro

when I die, bury me in Lapinha
breeches, blazer, shoulder pads

goodbye Bahia, zumzumzum, chain of gold
I'm leaving because they killed my Beetle

zumzumzum, it's Beetle
zumzumzum, chain of gold
