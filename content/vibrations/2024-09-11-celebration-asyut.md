I was walking by this house and stopped when I heard music. It was quite a sensation to hear such powerful sounds coming from a door. I didn't know what the context was, but someone might have explained to me later that it was a marriage-related celebration. Egypt and Brazil have two of my most favourite music cultures.

During my personal travels between 2018â€“2020, I recorded one minute of ambient sound in various places to practice being still and appreciating what's around me, especially the so-called 'noise' which, although often ignored, can be quite rich when paying closer attention. The photos are just for fun and not necessary.
