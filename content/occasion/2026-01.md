Comforting to be in Berlin again, even if it's the "worst weather of the year". I know lots of people here and feel it's more conducive than many places to the kind of life I enjoy.

After some months in Portugal of checking out places to settle long-term, my partner and I are seeking rest and familiarity. It was 'only' two cities but somehow felt like lots of moving around and figuring out how a new place works; I might be discovering that I now need at least three months in a place to feel relaxed. Still considering to try the same with France later.

Over the holidays, I rabbitholed on family tree data visualization and made some cool designs that I'll be proud to share soon.

I find myself reflecting on the connections between business, marketing, helping people, pedagogy, sustainable project work, and how I might incorporate these layers together in a way that's aligned with my values.

Last year, I might have spent half my time on private projects, so I'm looking forward to more public things. This year will mark twenty years of the rosano.ca domain name so I'd like to do some looking back as well as finally get to a newer homepage concept that reflects my current perspective.

### [Kathy Sierra: Badass — Making Users Awesome](https://rosano.ca/log/series/kathy-sierra-badass-making-users-awesome/)

The layout of this book makes me cringe but it's got tons of great ideas for making products more approachable.

> [Anticipate the faces they're likely to make and compensate for their inability to show you.]

> [They need to believe they'll improve, then _actually_ improve, and also realize they've improved.]

> [If they're worried about breaking something, they'll hesitate to touch anything. Make recovery easy. Help them feel free to just try things. Consider it a "Wild Experimentation Mode."]

### [Seth Godin: This Is Marketing](https://rosano.ca/log/series/seth-godin-this-is-marketing/)

So much in here that speaks to the tension between creating for myself versus for others. I'd like to get better at this.

> [Building new things for your customers (instead of finding new customers for your things) implies investing in their lifetime value.]

> [A supermarket might expect the lifetime value of their regulars to be thousands of dollars, so they would do well to 1. sponsor events for new residents in the area and 2. do right when a local complains about the fruit not being ripe.]

> If the goal is to get it over with, get the person off the phone, deny responsibility, read the script, use words like "as stated" and "our policy," then, please, sure, yes, keep doing what you're doing and watch it all fall apart.

> [A brand is not your logo: it's the promise they think they're making.]

> "I made this" is a very different statement than, "What do you want?"

> [Specific is kind of brave as it's accountable: it either worked, matched, spread, or it didn't. Are you hiding behind _everyone_ or _anyone_?]

> [Find a corner of the market that can't wait for your attention, where you are the perfect answer.]

> [When you show up with a flotation device to help someone drowning, they don't need ads to understand or be persuaded.]

### [Christopher Alexander: A city is not a tree](https://rosano.ca/log/series/christopher-alexander-a-city-is-not-a-tree/)

> [In a natural city, play happens in a thousand places within the cracks of adult life. Children become full of their surroundings through play, unless they're in a fenced-off cage.]

> [Putting a concert hall beside an opera house is almost never practical to either audience, and only a consequence of that simple-minded part of us which puts things with the same name in the same basket.]

### [Neil Davidson: Don’t Just Roll the Dice](https://rosano.ca/log/series/neil-davidson-dont-just-roll-the-dice/)

> [Your price represents not just the product but also the documentation, support, and future roadmap.]

> [Sage accounting software sucks, but you buy _reliability_ in knowing it will update for new tax laws, your bookkeeper's likely _familiarity_ with the product, and the _support_ of staff who respond to forty thousand callers a day.]

> [Black and Decker introduced their DeWALT drill series by giving away pulled pork sandwiches and holding drill-off competitions at construction sites, and being present at rodeos and NASCAR races where their end users hang out.]

### [Gerard Taylor: Capoeira Conditioning](https://rosano.ca/log/series/gerard-taylor-capoeira-conditioning/)

> with correct deep breathing, the ribs gently massage the spine and internal organs.

### [Mark Douglas: Trading in the Zone](https://rosano.ca/log/series/mark-douglas-trading-in-the-zone/)

> [If you woke up one day and everyone acted as if you didn't exist, you'd probably try to shake someone out of it. Beliefs will act the same way if purposefully ignored and force their presence to be acknowledged.]

> Thinking outside of the boundaries of our beliefs is commonly referred to as creative thinking.

> Since we can't expect something we don't know about, we could also say that an expectation is what we know projected into some future moment.

[Destigmatize being dumb](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/destigmatize-being-dumb)

The military does this with matters of life & death _(if admitting failure is punished, people hide failure)_. If you find an inefficiency in the economy, you can make a lot of money fixing it _(through betting on the stock market, or starting a business)_.

[Confessions to a data lake](https://confer.to/blog/2025/12/confessions-to-a-data-lake/)

> When advertising comes to AI assistants, they will slowly become oriented around convincing us of something (to buy something, to join something, to identify with something), but they will be armed with total knowledge of your context, your concerns, your hesitations. It will be as if a third party pays your therapist to convince you of something.

learning and teaching are two sides of the same coin, so caring or not caring about one implies the same about the other

Choosing to 'skip over parts' _is_ reading because reflects a choice about what's being processed.

If I've absorbed something through my own lived experience or heard of it in another context, I'm still "reading" the idea as I recognize it well enough to skip over.

Cultural or self-inflicted frowning upon 'screens causing us to skim rather than read' creates pressure to do things 'properly', but comparisons are not relevant: set your own objectives and make your own meaning.

Skipping is about feeling when you're not connected so that you can move to yes.

[Filó Machado: FÉ CEGA / FACA AMOLADA](https://youtu.be/l470P-l5glA)

pure musicianship with mostly guitar, beatboxing, and vocal rhythmics leading to some very happy music; complex harmonies remind me of Toninho Horta and Jacob Collier (especially the changing shirts).

[Mestre Gato Preto: The art of the berimbau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfC40CuV0So)

mostly berimbau without singing, solo and with the drum section, great swing

[Simon Stuij: Alles Raakt Mij](https://simonstuij.bandcamp.com/track/alles-raakt-mij)

tight drumming, nice contrast between sections

[breathe.: London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpZeNkSCxXc)

would love to know the genre that is named for this chord progression.

---

[Maribel La Canija: Mediterráneo](https://youtu.be/RyOS8KYnwCM)

many 'typical/cliche' progressions but nice surprise resolutions, crunches, and resolutions. timefeel includes triplets. bass solo has this "suspended in the air" feeling i tend to seek out.

---

[KNOWER: It's All Nothing Until It's Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDpeHQUSWT0)

deadly intricate rhythmic precision juxtaposed with smooth flowing head-banging melody.
