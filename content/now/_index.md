I'm currently in Porto with my partner to research affordable places to settle in Europe. Portugal seems to have many places that could fit our streetrat backpacker lifestyle, but France or Germany are also interesting as I have more friends and connections there.

After spending too much time this year concentrated on administrative things, I'm finally able to make some much needed progress on my projects.

I've been waiting for years to make a better homepage as I lately felt the present one is a good representation for what I do. Currently doing some very satisfying work to put all my publishing together inside [Journal](https://rosano.ca/log).

There are Strolling conversations from 2023 that I wasn't able to edit in 2024. I want to get to each of them at some point but it's a slow process as I still haven't managed to delegate this or get other people involved. I might accept that it's my work to do, and be content that it takes the time it does.

Still meeting people along my way but noticing a new satisfaction in the last year with solitude, and not seeking so much activity or external interaction. I think it's healthy and not coming from a place of sadness or repressionâ€”I just feel comfortable with myself.

I have lots of dreams about what lies ahead, mostly technical but some not. It's fun to imagine accumulating the various threads and skills in my life so that they come together into something powerful or just fun. Definitely pulled into the future at the moment, rather than pushed.
