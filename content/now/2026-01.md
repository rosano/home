Comforting to be in Berlin again, even if it's the "worst weather of the year". I know lots of people here and feel it's more conducive than many places to the kind of life I enjoy.

After the last months in Portugal of checking out places to settle long-term, my partner and I are seeking rest and familiarity. It was 'only' two cities but somehow felt like lots of moving around and figuring out how a new place works; I might be discovering that I now need at least three months in a place to feel relaxed. Still considering to try the same with France later.

Over the holidays, I rabbitholed on family tree data visualization and made some cool designs that I'll be proud to share soon.

I find myself reflecting on the connections between business, marketing, helping, pedagogy, sustainable project work, and how I might incorporate these layers together in a way that's aligned with my values.

Last year, I might have spent half my time on private projects, so I'm looking forward to more public things. This year will mark the twenty years of the rosano.ca domain name so I'd like to do some looking back as well as finally get to a newer homepage concept that reflects my current perspective.
