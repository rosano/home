Since 2023 I've been recording piano music from my past. This is one I played in my university audition.

Bach's music feels so beautiful and timeless. Do many people like it just because others like it? Or is there something about how it's constructed that reaches us in a certain way?

Notice how the prelude accompaniment is simply 'one note per beat', or how the entire fugue is basically the same fragment in different permutations; I find this 'economy of expression' inspiring.
