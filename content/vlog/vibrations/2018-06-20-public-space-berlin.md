title: public space in Berlin
summary: "Public sofas… Why not?"
---
The first time I visited Berlin, the area I stayed in gave me this feeling of calm and coziness such that I'd want to come back. I see more layers now after spending time in other neighbourhoods, but nice to connect with an old feeling by revisiting this moment.

My time there definitely gave me an appreciation for public spaces, as they aren't so common in other places I've visited. And yeah, public sofas… Why not?
