[Bobby McFerrin: Circlesongs - Live in Budapest (2018)](https://youtu.be/q9TzHi-nxHM)

Been appreciating lately how hard it is to sing in tune and so I enjoyed this on a higher level than normal.

[27:17](https://youtu.be/q9TzHi-nxHM?t=1637s): wildly precise abstract tuning, singing, and gibberish without turning into a mess.

[31:31](https://youtu.be/q9TzHi-nxHM?t=1891): groovy bass-y beatboxing to support instrument-like vocal solos.

[43:31](https://youtu.be/q9TzHi-nxHM?t=2611): improvised speaking through music and singing, realistic voice-only drum groove; polyrhythmic breaking of Bobby's voice to create effects.
