[Wanting & Capitalism](https://modernbuddhism.substack.com/p/wanting-and-capitalism)

> You don’t go to Satan’s Discounter for your golden lute. Don’t use our evil overlord to buy something (gasp) REAL—something you’ll use forever and that will become a part of you. That would be like using a dating app to find the love of your life…

> I found a pen shop. A little hole-in-the-wall. The kind of place I’m surprised exists, glad too. It has probably been in the family for generations, passed from papa to son, while the neighborhood around them has slowly been turned into an outdoor luxury mall.

> It doesn’t matter if you have 100 attachments or one attachment. You still have attachments. There’s no practical distance between one and 100.

> Ideally we should try to notice and hold our attachments with an open hand. Ready to let them go when the time is right.

> When you live out of a backpack, you can’t have favorites. You need to survive. If I weren’t walking all day, I could wear jeans, mosey around cafes, and twirl my mustache. Unfortunately, my current (self-assigned) profession involves walking seven days a week.
