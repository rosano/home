[for the chronic criticizers](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C38y7lvM6yD/)

> [When someone always criticizes you: 1) ask if was meant for you or if they just wanted to hear it out loud; 2) ask "how am I supposed to do that?" to tease out whether they have actually thought about it practically; and 3) confirm that "what I'm hearing isâ€¦" to clarify if there's anything constructive.]
