[Visual design rules you can safely follow every time](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/)

> [Differentiate hues in a palette with unique brightness values.]

> [Saturate your neutrals with warm or cool colours, but not both.]

> [Spacing better separates contrasting elements than similar ones.]
