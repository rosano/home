[CONSPIRACY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqkK0RLNkI)

> [Nudging people towards your conclusion while making them think they arrived there themselves will keep them resistant to questioning their basis for belief.]

> [Conspiracism is more invested in the issues of specific leaders (bad satan worshippers) than the structure of power itself.]

> [The face of Jesus and Mary may be commonly found on toast and fruit in Christian nations, wheras the name of Allah might be found on cantaloupe skins in Indonesia.]

> ['Is it possible thatâ€¦' has a very low barrier for proof.]

> [One function of the 'satanic ritual abuse' conspiracy is to deny that sexual violence is banal and that culture empowers men to do it.]
